The tornado did minor roof and siding damage to many homes along Lake Road, as well as topple several trees and snapped a power line. The worst of the damage, which was rated EF-1, was to a large metal shed that was destroyed and the roof was lofted into nearby trees and pushed hundreds of feet down the street.

Near downtown, another large oak tree fell onto the front of a home, causing damage.","A line of thunderstorms developed from southwest Missouri into central Illinois late in the morning. These storms then moved east-southeastward through the afternoon, producing isolated strong winds in southern Illinois. The storms occurred south and east of a cold front trailing from a low in southwestern Iowa back across Kansas to the Texas Panhandle. Some daytime heating and destabilization resulted in a gradual increase in coverage and intensity of storms. Wind shear was sufficient for organization of the storms. Around 30 knots of low-level south-southwesterly flow veered to west-southwesterly at mid levels.",226

Damage in this area consisted of several downed highway signs and a bent light pole. The tornado moved northeast and intensified rapidly after crossing I-255, striking an Amazon warehouse. The west-facing walls of the warehouse collapsed inward, which was followed by multiple structural failures as the tornado moved through the complex, including the collapse of additional walls and the loss of a large segment of the roof. This was the worst damage along the entire tornado track rated EF-3. Cars in the rear of the building were strewn eastward and power lines and several large high tension towers were also destroyed. There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST.
