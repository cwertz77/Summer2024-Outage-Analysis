The first tornado damage observed was near the intersection of E1050 Avenue and N1375 Street where a greenhouse lost portions of its roofing material and suffered other minor damage. The tornado continued northeast toward Gatch Lake causing damage to several outbuildings and one single family residence. The width of the tornado increased to nearly 100 yards wide and the strength increased from EF0 to EF1 during this time period. The tornado continued northeast causing mainly tree damage until it reached a farm along E1200 Avenue near N1780 Lane. Here a barn and several silos were destroyed, along with a single wide mobile home. The damage was rated EF2. Thankfully there were no occupants in the mobile home at the time of the tornado. The tornado continued northeast destroying another outbuilding, with the debris being tossed down wind hundreds of yards into the open field.  The greatest tornado damage occurred to a residence near the intersection of Illinois Highway 185 and E1250 Avenue. The tornado destroyed their garage, ripped their roof and southeast walls off of their home. This damage was also rated EF2 with winds estimated to be 125 mph. The tornado began to weaken as it moved northeast only causing minor damage to an outbuilding and downing trees in a narrow path, less than a hundred yards wide, to the Fayette/Effingham county line. No injuries or deaths were reported in Fayette County.  The tornado continued northeast into Effingham County (WFO Lincoln's forecast area). This segment of the tornado (Fayette County) was rated EF2 with a path length of 10.87 miles and a max path width of 100 yards. The entire tornado was rated EF2.

It also damaged the windows of a home and an automobile.  As the tornado continued, it damaged three farmsteads... where it damaged or destroyed six additional outbuildings, a camper, an unoccupied trailer, and numerous trees.  The tornado dissipated in a forested area about 3.4 miles northwest of Mason at 4:41 PM CDT.","Low pressure tracking across central Illinois triggered a line of fast-moving thunderstorms during the afternoon of April 3rd.  The storms primarily impacted locations south of the I-72 corridor, with one cell embedded within the line producing an EF-1 tornado in southern Effingham County.  Thunderstorms earlier in the day dropped locally heavy rainfall of 3-5 inches across portions of Coles County, including 3.76 in Charelston.  Due to excessive rainfall rates over a short period of time, flash flooding occurred in the Charleston-Mattoon area.

It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings.  The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.
