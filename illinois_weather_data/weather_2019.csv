While the crest was among the ten highest on record, the extended duration of the flood played an even greater role on the impact. The combination of seepage and relief wells along the levees permitted large amounts of water to seep into normally dry areas. The biggest impacts in Alexander County were weeks after the river crested. Portions of Illinois Routes 3 and 146 were flooded and closed from the East Cape Girardeau area down to Thebes. A number of residences were flooded in McClure and East Cape Girardeau. Further south, the breach in the Len Small levee continued to permit large amounts of water into the Miller City area. A U.S. Geological Survey measurement determined that at least 20 percent of the total Mississippi River flow was exiting through the break in the Len Small levee. County roads and swaths of cropland were damaged extensively by fast-flowing water around the levee break. Six barges passed through the levee break and became stuck on Miller City Road. The loose barges damaged irrigation pivots and farm equipment.
