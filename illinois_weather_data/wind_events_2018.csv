The first tornado damage observed was near the intersection of E1050 Avenue and N1375 Street where a greenhouse lost portions of its roofing material and suffered other minor damage. The tornado continued northeast toward Gatch Lake causing damage to several outbuildings and one single family residence. The width of the tornado increased to nearly 100 yards wide and the strength increased from EF0 to EF1 during this time period. The tornado continued northeast causing mainly tree damage until it reached a farm along E1200 Avenue near N1780 Lane. Here a barn and several silos were destroyed, along with a single wide mobile home. The damage was rated EF2. Thankfully there were no occupants in the mobile home at the time of the tornado. The tornado continued northeast destroying another outbuilding, with the debris being tossed down wind hundreds of yards into the open field.  The greatest tornado damage occurred to a residence near the intersection of Illinois Highway 185 and E1250 Avenue. The tornado destroyed their garage, ripped their roof and southeast walls off of their home. This damage was also rated EF2 with winds estimated to be 125 mph. The tornado began to weaken as it moved northeast only causing minor damage to an outbuilding and downing trees in a narrow path, less than a hundred yards wide, to the Fayette/Effingham county line. No injuries or deaths were reported in Fayette County.  The tornado continued northeast into Effingham County (WFO Lincoln's forecast area). This segment of the tornado (Fayette County) was rated EF2 with a path length of 10.87 miles and a max path width of 100 yards. The entire tornado was rated EF2.

The tornado passed near the community of Wolf Lake before dissipating at the edge of the Shawnee National Forest just east of Route 3. A very large equipment barn collapsed, and another barn was destroyed. A one-story house was partially shifted off its foundation. All structural damage was between Route 3 and the Mississippi River levee. The tornado was witnessed by at least one trained spotter and several other individuals. Prior to spawning this tornado, the parent storm produced a tornado near Trail of Tears State Park in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri about ten minutes earlier.","Multiple rounds of thunderstorms impacted the region on the last day of May. Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms.
