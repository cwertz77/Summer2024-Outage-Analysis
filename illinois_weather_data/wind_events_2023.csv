The tornado tracked northeastward, doing minor structural damage to a machine shed along County Highway 1 near Pierceburg.  Numerous wooden power poles were snapped and heavy damage to trees was noted with tops sheared off about 30 feet above ground.  Structural damage to homes of the EF1-EF2 variety occurred as the tornado moved across County Highway 15 where two single family homes sustained major roof damage.  A mobile home was torn in half with its debris strewn about 20 yards in opposite directions.  Trees, while sparse in this area, were sheared about 20-30 feet above the ground.  Further east along County Highway 15, structural damage occurred to a large machine shed where a stationary semi-trailer blew into its west-facing wall causing the entire structure to fail.  The debris from the large machine shed then blew into an old, poorly anchored single-family residence and caused exterior walls to slide off its foundation.  Over the next 3 miles along the path of the tornado just before it reached the south side of Robinson, considerable tree damage was observed.||As the tornado tracked into the south side of Robinson, it narrowly missed a major oil refinery.  The tornado destroyed two manufactured homes resulting in two fatalities as it crossed County Highway 9 near the interchange of East 900th Avenue and North 1200th Street.  Damage to structures, trees, and wooden power poles was determined to be EF1-EF2.||Heavy structural damage (EF3) and an additional fatality were noted on the east side of Robinson near the interchange of State Highway 1 and East 1050th Avenue where a two-story masonry building experienced failure to its top story walls.  The adjacent properties also experienced heavy damage where the exterior walls of two |single-family homes collapsed.  Damage to trees and utility poles in this area was extensive due to the amount of debris strewn toward the northeast. ||The tornado then moved over Robinson Municipal Airport, destroying airport hangers and a small outbuilding.  The progressive collapse of the rigid frames of the metal building systems, which included steel beams measuring greater than 18 inches in diameter, caused the survey team to estimate EF3 damage at this point.||A continuous track of EF1 damage then extended northeastward across County Highway 5 where multiple single-family homes exhibited large sections of their roof structures removed.  In addition, multiple large machine sheds experienced a collapse of their wall structures. ||The survey team concluded that the storm likely maintained its intensity as it tracked northeastward toward the Wabash River, noting about a quarter-mile wide swath of heavy tree damage to distant tree lines as it continued toward the river.  The tornado then crossed the Wabash River into the National Weather Service Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) in western Sullivan County at 9:21pm CDT.","Two rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms spawned 13 tornadoes across central Illinois during the afternoon and evening of March 31st...including an EF-3 tornado that killed 3 people in Robinson in Crawford County.

Two areas of storms were present during the mid to late afternoon, one entering the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City metros and another around the Burlington and Fort Madison metros. The first was the most severe, producing hail up to baseball size in Koszta, Iowa and widespread wind damage, especially around West Liberty, Iowa. This storm, and storms to the west, eventually merged into a cluster of severe thunderstorms, producing large hail and destructive winds around 70-75 mph all the way to Mount Pleasant, Iowa and Macomb, Illinois. The latter produced sporadic reports of quarter to half dollar sized hail, along with a brief landspout tornado east of Yorktown, IL.  There was also severe blowing dust which was especially bad near I-55 in north central Illinois.

The hardest hit counties were Alexander, Pulaski, and Massac in the southern tip of Illinois. Widespread flash flooding of roads made travel difficult or impossible for several hours during the peak of the heaviest rainfall in the morning. There was a bridge that was washed out in Massac County on a secondary road. Among the most impactful road closures was Interstate 57 in Pulaski County. Illinois Route 3 was closed to most vehicles except large trucks at the underpass on the north side of Cairo. Several water rescues were conducted for people stranded in vehicles in Massac, Pulaski, and Alexander Counties. A number of roads were washed out in several counties. The impacts in the Marion, Carbondale, and Herrin areas consisted of street flooding, as well as some minor flooding of a few structures in flood-prone areas. Widespread rainfall totals ranging from 5 to 9 inches occurred along and south of a line from Carbondale to Marion, including the Cairo and Metropolis areas. The majority of this rain fell within a 10-hour window between midnight and 10 AM. The highest reported rainfall total was 8.68 inches in Ullin (Pulaski County). The co-op site near Cairo received 7.83 of rain.|| The historic rainfall event was caused by a persistent thunderstorm complex that continually regenerated as it moved southeast across the region during the early morning hours of the 19th. This complex of thunderstorms was indirectly caused by the complex of severe thunderstorms during the midday hours of the 18th. The complex on the 18th left an outflow boundary from south central Missouri into northeast Arkansas. This boundary lifted back northeast into southeast Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours of July 19th. At the same time, a southwest low-level jet ramped up over the top of the surface boundary. Extremely high moisture levels were present, with precipitable water values up to 2.3 inches. The position of the boundary oriented parallel with the upper-level wind flow provided an ideal setup for training convection over the same areas. The initial storms blew up by 11 PM and continued to channel southeastward across the same areas through the following morning.",249
