The extreme cold was indirectly responsible for a number of structure fires caused by supplemental heating sources, such as space heaters. One hypothermia fatality was reported in Pulaski County. A 67-year-old male residing in a condemned structure with no utilities was found deceased. There were numerous reports of frozen water pipes that burst and flooded homes and other buildings. In Harrisburg, a nursing home roof collapsed due to busted water pipes. An underground water main burst in Carterville, leading officials to issue a boil water advisory for the city. An antique shop burned in Pinckneyville, and firefighters were hampered by low water pressure. On top of the extreme cold, one to three inches of snow fell.
