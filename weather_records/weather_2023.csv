Snowfall rates were quite heavy for a couple hours, even around an inch per hour. Roads were snow-covered and slippery during the heavy snow, with numerous vehicles sliding off the road. Temperatures rose above freezing soon after the snow ended, so treated roads improved rather quickly later in the morning. The snow occurred northwest of a surface low that moved from Memphis, TN to Murray and Owensboro, KY. Once temperatures cooled during the evening of the 24th, enough cold air remained in place for widespread snow.",44

The tornado tracked northeastward, doing minor structural damage to a machine shed along County Highway 1 near Pierceburg.  Numerous wooden power poles were snapped and heavy damage to trees was noted with tops sheared off about 30 feet above ground.  Structural damage to homes of the EF1-EF2 variety occurred as the tornado moved across County Highway 15 where two single family homes sustained major roof damage.  A mobile home was torn in half with its debris strewn about 20 yards in opposite directions.  Trees, while sparse in this area, were sheared about 20-30 feet above the ground.  Further east along County Highway 15, structural damage occurred to a large machine shed where a stationary semi-trailer blew into its west-facing wall causing the entire structure to fail.  The debris from the large machine shed then blew into an old, poorly anchored single-family residence and caused exterior walls to slide off its foundation.  Over the next 3 miles along the path of the tornado just before it reached the south side of Robinson, considerable tree damage was observed.||As the tornado tracked into the south side of Robinson, it narrowly missed a major oil refinery.  The tornado destroyed two manufactured homes resulting in two fatalities as it crossed County Highway 9 near the interchange of East 900th Avenue and North 1200th Street.  Damage to structures, trees, and wooden power poles was determined to be EF1-EF2.||Heavy structural damage (EF3) and an additional fatality were noted on the east side of Robinson near the interchange of State Highway 1 and East 1050th Avenue where a two-story masonry building experienced failure to its top story walls.  The adjacent properties also experienced heavy damage where the exterior walls of two |single-family homes collapsed.  Damage to trees and utility poles in this area was extensive due to the amount of debris strewn toward the northeast. ||The tornado then moved over Robinson Municipal Airport, destroying airport hangers and a small outbuilding.  The progressive collapse of the rigid frames of the metal building systems, which included steel beams measuring greater than 18 inches in diameter, caused the survey team to estimate EF3 damage at this point.||A continuous track of EF1 damage then extended northeastward across County Highway 5 where multiple single-family homes exhibited large sections of their roof structures removed.  In addition, multiple large machine sheds experienced a collapse of their wall structures. ||The survey team concluded that the storm likely maintained its intensity as it tracked northeastward toward the Wabash River, noting about a quarter-mile wide swath of heavy tree damage to distant tree lines as it continued toward the river.

Aided by an increasingly unstable airmass characterized by CAPE values of 3000-4000J/kg and a 30-40kt mid-level jet streak, the storms became linear in nature and began racing east-southeastward across central Illinois.  Widespread wind gusts of 60-80mph were observed along the line, with localized corridors of even higher gusts.  The highest measured gust of 101 mph came from a personal weather station near Taylorville that took a direct hit from a tornado.  A total of seven tornadoes were embedded within the line of storms, including an EF-2 tornado near Curran in Sangamon County.  The high winds caused extensive tree and power line damage, leading to power loss for over 200,000 customers.  Some people in the Springfield area were without power for nearly a week before all lines were restored. The winds impacted all of central and southeast Illinois, but were most concentrated between the I-74 and I-70 corridors.

In Venedy, widespread tree damage around town, a grain bin was damaged, as well as several power lines blown down. Three miles south southeast of Venedy, at the intersection of County Road 12 and Stone Church Road, a training center sustained major roof damage. About 3 miles south southwest of Okawville, a large barn was destroyed. Then just southwest of Okawville, multiple large treetops were snapped off and a barn and a machine shed were destroyed. Along County Highway 13, south of Okawville, two small barns were destroyed and two grain bins sustained minor damage. In Addieville, there was widespread tree and power line damage, as well as roof damage to a local business. As the storm moved into the Nashville area, numerous trees, tree limbs, power poles and power lines were blown down. One house sustained moderate roof damage due to a fallen tree. Also, a local business sustained roof damage with water causing interior damage as well. In Ashley, there was widespread tree, tree limbs and power lines blown down. One large tree fell onto a house causing moderate roof damage. Also, a number of trees were blown down onto Illinois Route 15. In Radom, a large tree was blown down onto a garage, destroying it.

During a 12-hour period from 3 AM to 3 PM CST, storm total rainfall in Cook County ranged from 1-9 inches, with the highest amounts in central Cook County near the border of Chicago, Cicero, and Oak Park. The magnitude of this rainfall ranged from typical to extreme, with the peak rainfall estimated to have less than a 0.2% chance of occurring in a given year. Two distinct waves of heavy rainfall occurred in the Chicago area during this event, with each period of heavy rainfall corresponding to significant flooding.||The first wave of heavy rainfall impacted the Chicago area from 4:30 AM to 11 AM CST. Within a few hours numerous residential streets were flooded and I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway) was blocked in multiple locations, as well as a stretch of I-55 (Stevenson Expressway) near Pulaski Road. Multiple water rescues were reported, most of which occurred at underpasses in Chicago and the immediate western suburbs. Runoff quickly entered the deep tunnel system and mostly filled McCook Reservoir, greatly reducing storage capacity for additional rainfall.||After a brief period with lighter rainfall intensities from 11 AM to 12:30 PM CST, the second wave of heavy began, which occurred until 3:30 PM CST. This additional rainfall brought renewed flooding of numerous roadways as well as portions of CTA's blue and pink El train lines. The storage capacity of the deep tunnel and McCook Reservoir were exceeded, with most rainfall flowing into the Chicago River system as part of a combined sewer overflow event. The Chicago River quickly rose to minor flood stage, flooding the Chicago Riverwalk. MWRD opened gates at Chicago Lock to reverse the flow of the river into Lake Michigan, causing a mixture of rainfall and untreated sewage to enter the lake. The lack of capacity to store combined rain water and sewage caused rainfall to back up into 10s of thousands of basements. As of November 29th, 2023, FEMA had received nearly 75,000 claims for flooded homes, the majority of which are assumed to be basement flooding. Approximately $285 million in FEMA individual assistance grants were provided, along with $96.5 million in low-interest SBA loans. These federal disaster assistance programs only cover a portion of uninsured losses. Few claims, less than $1 million in total, were made to the National Flood Insurance program due to the low percentage of residents paying for such polices and the cause of most instances of flooding being related to sewer backup. The estimated total damage costs from this flash flood event are likely in excess of $500 million.","An extreme rainfall event occurred on July 2 in the Chicago metropolitan area caused by multiple nearly stationary bands of showers and thunderstorms near a slow-moving low pressure area.

Several water rescues were conducted for people stranded in vehicles in Massac, Pulaski, and Alexander Counties. A number of roads were washed out in several counties. The impacts in the Marion, Carbondale, and Herrin areas consisted of street flooding, as well as some minor flooding of a few structures in flood-prone areas. Widespread rainfall totals ranging from 5 to 9 inches occurred along and south of a line from Carbondale to Marion, including the Cairo and Metropolis areas. The majority of this rain fell within a 10-hour window between midnight and 10 AM. The highest reported rainfall total was 8.68 inches in Ullin (Pulaski County). The co-op site near Cairo received 7.83 of rain.|| The historic rainfall event was caused by a persistent thunderstorm complex that continually regenerated as it moved southeast across the region during the early morning hours of the 19th. This complex of thunderstorms was indirectly caused by the complex of severe thunderstorms during the midday hours of the 18th. The complex on the 18th left an outflow boundary from south central Missouri into northeast Arkansas. This boundary lifted back northeast into southeast Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours of July 19th. At the same time, a southwest low-level jet ramped up over the top of the surface boundary. Extremely high moisture levels were present, with precipitable water values up to 2.3 inches. The position of the boundary oriented parallel with the upper-level wind flow provided an ideal setup for training convection over the same areas. The initial storms blew up by 11 PM and continued to channel southeastward across the same areas through the following morning.",251
