The area is fairly prone to flooding of the Cache River. The vehicle was found completely submerged in Cache River floodwaters. A volunteer fire and rescue squad located the vehicle and the body of the motorist. The body of the female motorist was found in a flooded field about 100 feet from the vehicle. It appeared she may have tried to turn around, and the vehicle ended up in a flooded ditch. The incident was reported by a tow-truck driver who towed a second vehicle out of the floodwater. The driver of the second vehicle got out safely, but the vehicle was almost completely submerged except for a small part of the top.","A very heavy rainfall event on the 3rd caused the Cache River to overflow its banks. A potent storm system lifted out of the Southwest during the first few days of the year. An area of low pressure opened up as it entered the southern Plains. Widespread moderate to heavy rain fell between the 2nd and 4th. One to three inch totals were common during this time period, with isolated reports between four and five inches.",1

All of this rain caused the river to rise to major flood. About a dozen homes and businesses in Evansville were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters.","A prolonged period of rainfall occurred from the early morning hours of December 26th to the evening of December 28th.  The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.",353
