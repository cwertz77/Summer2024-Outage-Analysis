This is due to the Insulation Promotional Rebate and the Low-Income Insulation Program we offered in Winter of 2022.   Also, we added a Furnace Tune Up Rebate in Fall of 2022 for our residential customers.  All three of these programs were very popular.   2) Our cost of MWh for Residential is still high.  We offer rebates that save on electric and gas (because we are also a gas utility) and our costs are usually higher when the customer is saving both electric and gas from the same rebate (insulation, smart thermostat for example)."
