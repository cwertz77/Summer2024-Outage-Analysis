NOTE:  Our assumed baseline for residential heating programs has changed our reported results.  These programs would now show negative life cycle electrical savings due to long life programs with off peak electrical energy growth.  There are large BTUH savings from customers switching from propane and natural gas but they cannot be reported using this report.  This form does not allow negative savings so we are not reporting these programs.
