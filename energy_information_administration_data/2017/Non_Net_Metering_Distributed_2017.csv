"Note: Data includes distributed generators less than 1 MW capacity, not net metered, and not reported on the EIA-860.
Data is reported as collected.
Type refers to the nature of the PV system reporting. EIA uses the type reported from Net Metering unless they informed us otherwise. All non AC units are converted to AC when summed.
Generators may be installed at or near a customer's site, or at other locations. They may be owned by either the customers of the distribution utility or the utility.
Other generators includes generators for which technology is not specified. Number of generators is not available by individual technology type.
Some utilities reclassified net metering as non net metering distributed, or vice versa.
Some utilties were double counting net metering as distributed in previous years.
