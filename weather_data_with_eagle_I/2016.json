            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "Mississippi River levels continued their climb from December, and record flooding occurred early in the month. At the Thebes river gage, the river crested at a new record of 47.74 feet before dawn on the 2nd. The old record was 45.91 feet, which was set in May of 1995. Records at Thebes go back to at least 1844. The 2016 crest would have been higher if a major levee break had not occurred in Alexander County. Flood stage at Thebes is 33 feet. The primary flood-related impact was a large levee break (about one-quarter mile wide) in the Len Small Levee near Miller City, between Thebes and Cairo. This levee break contributed to major flooding in and near the communities of Olive Branch and Miller City. Several dozen residences were flooded, some of them by water up to seven feet deep. Voluntary evacuations were requested as floodwaters inundated these communities and cut off access roads. Many homes and businesses in these communities were sandbagged, but many of them ended up being flooded. A Red Cross shelter was opened at Cape Girardeau. The National Guard was requested to assist with sandbagging operations and levee repairs. A couple of relatively small levee breaches were reported between Miller City and Cairo. The levee protecting East Cape Girardeau was in danger of failing, and residents of that community were advised to evacuate. Schools were closed in much of the county due to widespread evacuations. The impact of all of this flooding would have been much greater during the growing season, when crop losses would have been extreme. Because of the high water, barge traffic was restricted on the Mississippi River.",

Extensive flooding occurred on the northern outskirts of Mount Carmel. Numerous local river roads were flooded. High water backed up into Bon Pas Creek. Installation of flood gates at Mount Carmel was necessary. Access to local camp sites was blocked, but there was minimal impact to commercial activities because of gate closure.

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "Mississippi River levels continued their climb from December, and record or near-record flooding occurred early in the month. There are no river gages in Union County, but there is a gage at Thebes in nearby Alexander County. At the Thebes river gage, the river crested at a new record of 47.74 feet on the 2nd. Backwater from the Mississippi River contributed to flooding of Clear Creek and other tributaries, which affected isolated homes. Some residents were isolated by the floodwaters. Sandbagging operations were conducted to protect water wells and to reinforce levees. The National Guard was activated to assist with the sandbagging. A number of residents voluntarily evacuated. Most of the monetary flood damage was to public infrastructure, such as roads and levees. All access roads to the Mississippi River levees were closed.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Flooding along parts of the Mississippi River surpassed the Great Flood of 1993. Along most other rivers, the flooding was relatively minor. The Governor of Illinois declared some counties disaster areas, including the Mississippi River counties of Alexander and Jackson. The very wet pattern that developed during the second half of December gradually dried out in January. This allowed all the rivers to fall below flood stage during the early or middle part of the month. The duration and seasonal timing of this Mississippi River flood was exceptionally rare. Past historical Mississippi River floods have occurred during the warm season, and their duration was on the scale of months rather than weeks.",

The snow was generally along and east of a line from Fairfield to Marion to Cairo. Rain changed to snow from west to east as temperatures fell quickly below freezing. Winds became northwest and increased to around 15 mph with gusts from 20 to 30 mph. Specific snowfall amounts included: 3 inches at Harrisburg and Golconda, 2 inches at Mount Carmel, and 2.5 inches a couple miles north of Metropolis. The snow fell steadily for a few hours, with visibility below one mile. Warm ground temperatures and near-freezing air temperatures limited accumulations at first. As temperatures dropped into the lower 20's, wet and slushy road surfaces became icy. The brisk winds lowered wind chills to between 5 and 15 above in many areas. There was some minor blowing and drifting of the snow across roadways. The synoptic setup consisted of a deep 500 mb trough over the Plains states that lifted northeast across the Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a weak low pressure center over Arkansas strengthened as it moved northeast to Ohio.

The snow was generally along and east of a line from Fairfield to Marion to Cairo. Rain changed to snow from west to east as temperatures fell quickly below freezing. Winds became northwest and increased to around 15 mph with gusts from 20 to 30 mph. Specific snowfall amounts included: 3 inches at Harrisburg and Golconda, 2 inches at Mount Carmel, and 2.5 inches a couple miles north of Metropolis. The snow fell steadily for a few hours, with visibility below one mile. Warm ground temperatures and near-freezing air temperatures limited accumulations at first. As temperatures dropped into the lower 20's, wet and slushy road surfaces became icy. The brisk winds lowered wind chills to between 5 and 15 above in many areas. There was some minor blowing and drifting of the snow across roadways. The synoptic setup consisted of a deep 500 mb trough over the Plains states that lifted northeast across the Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a weak low pressure center over Arkansas strengthened as it moved northeast to Ohio. Increasing northwest winds on the back side of the low brought the season's first bout of wintry weather.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "From one to three inches of snow fell across southern Illinois. The one-inch amounts were confined mainly along the Mississippi River. Amounts increased toward the northeast. Snowfall amounts averaged about two inches in the Mount Vernon and Marion-Carbondale areas, and they averaged near three inches from Harrisburg to the Wabash Valley. In the Wabash Valley region, a burst of heavy snow occurred for an hour or two. During this burst, the visibility dropped to around one-quarter mile. The snow readily bonded to paved surfaces due to the sub-freezing ground temperatures. A fatal vehicle accident occurred on Interstate 57 in southern Jefferson County shortly after the snow ended. The driver of a prisoner transport van lost control on the slick road and crossed the median into the path of a tractor-trailer rig. The semi driver was not injured. The van driver was killed, and a teenage passenger in the transport van was injured. Southbound Interstate 57 was closed between the Interstate 64 split and the Ina exit (near the Franklin County line) for about six hours. The synoptic situation was favorable for a winter weather event. A 500 mb shortwave trough lifted northeast from the southern high Plains to the mid and upper Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a weak low pressure system moved eastward into southern Arkansas. The burst of heavy snow was the result of strong warm air advection around 850 mb, which provided strong ascent.",

Amounts increased toward the northeast. Snowfall amounts averaged about two inches in the Mount Vernon and Marion-Carbondale areas, and they averaged near three inches from Harrisburg to the Wabash Valley. In the Wabash Valley region, a burst of heavy snow occurred for an hour or two. During this burst, the visibility dropped to around one-quarter mile. The snow readily bonded to paved surfaces due to the sub-freezing ground temperatures. A fatal vehicle accident occurred on Interstate 57 in southern Jefferson County shortly after the snow ended. The driver of a prisoner transport van lost control on the slick road and crossed the median into the path of a tractor-trailer rig. The semi driver was not injured. The van driver was killed, and a teenage passenger in the transport van was injured. Southbound Interstate 57 was closed between the Interstate 64 split and the Ina exit (near the Franklin County line) for about six hours. The synoptic situation was favorable for a winter weather event. A 500 mb shortwave trough lifted northeast from the southern high Plains to the mid and upper Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a weak low pressure system moved eastward into southern Arkansas. The burst of heavy snow was the result of strong warm air advection around 850 mb, which provided strong ascent.",

The snow readily bonded to paved surfaces due to the sub-freezing ground temperatures. A fatal vehicle accident occurred on Interstate 57 in southern Jefferson County shortly after the snow ended. The driver of a prisoner transport van lost control on the slick road and crossed the median into the path of a tractor-trailer rig. The semi driver was not injured. The van driver was killed, and a teenage passenger in the transport van was injured. Southbound Interstate 57 was closed between the Interstate 64 split and the Ina exit (near the Franklin County line) for about six hours. The synoptic situation was favorable for a winter weather event. A 500 mb shortwave trough lifted northeast from the southern high Plains to the mid and upper Mississippi Valley. At the surface, a weak low pressure system moved eastward into southern Arkansas. The burst of heavy snow was the result of strong warm air advection around 850 mb, which provided strong ascent.",

Snowfall amounts were heaviest along the Ohio River from Metropolis to Shawneetown (in Gallatin County), where 4 to 7 inches fell. Further northwest, 1 to 3 inches fell as far northwest as a line from Cairo to Vienna to Harrisburg and Carmi. The intensity of the snowfall varied greatly from one location to the next. The heavy snow occurred in bands associated with the deformation zone on the northwest side of the storm system. Snowfall rates in some of the bands were an inch per hour, with visibility reduced to about one-quarter mile. Some specific snowfall totals included: 7 inches in Hardin County (2 miles northwest of Elizabethtown), 7 inches in southwest Gallatin County (at Leamington), 6 inches in Pope County (5 miles north of Golconda), 3 inches at Cairo, and 2.5 inches at Harrisburg. Following the ending of the snow, strong north winds gusting from 30 to 40 mph caused widespread drifting. The drifts were especially deep in open farm country, where the lack of trees and other obstructions resulted in stronger winds. The winter storm was caused by a deepening 500 mb trough that swung eastward from the Plains across the Mississippi Valley early on the 22nd. A weak low pressure center formed over Texas early on the 21st. The low gradually strengthened as it moved northeast across Alabama early on the 22nd, reaching the Virginia coast early on the 23rd.  The low pressure system was accompanied by plenty of Gulf of Mexico moisture, which pivoted as far northwest as southeast Illinois.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Southern Illinois was on the northwest fringe of the wintry precipitation associated with a low pressure system over the Tennessee Valley. Snowfall amounts were heaviest along the Ohio River from Metropolis to Shawneetown (in Gallatin County), where 4 to 7 inches fell. Further northwest, 1 to 3 inches fell as far northwest as a line from Cairo to Vienna to Harrisburg and Carmi. The intensity of the snowfall varied greatly from one location to the next. The heavy snow occurred in bands associated with the deformation zone on the northwest side of the storm system. Snowfall rates in some of the bands were an inch per hour, with visibility reduced to about one-quarter mile. Some specific snowfall totals included: 7 inches in Hardin County (2 miles northwest of Elizabethtown), 7 inches in southwest Gallatin County (at Leamington), 6 inches in Pope County (5 miles north of Golconda), 3 inches at Cairo, and 2.5 inches at Harrisburg. Following the ending of the snow, strong north winds gusting from 30 to 40 mph caused widespread drifting. The drifts were especially deep in open farm country, where the lack of trees and other obstructions resulted in stronger winds. The winter storm was caused by a deepening 500 mb trough that swung eastward from the Plains across the Mississippi Valley early on the 22nd. A weak low pressure center formed over Texas early on the 21st. The low gradually strengthened as it moved northeast across Alabama early on the 22nd, reaching the Virginia coast early on the 23rd.  The low pressure system was accompanied by plenty of Gulf of Mexico moisture, which pivoted as far northwest as southeast Illinois. There was sufficient cold air in place for most of the precipitation to fall as snow.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Southern Illinois was on the northwest fringe of the wintry precipitation associated with a low pressure system over the Tennessee Valley. Snowfall amounts were heaviest along the Ohio River from Metropolis to Shawneetown (in Gallatin County), where 4 to 7 inches fell. Further northwest, 1 to 3 inches fell as far northwest as a line from Cairo to Vienna to Harrisburg and Carmi. The intensity of the snowfall varied greatly from one location to the next. The heavy snow occurred in bands associated with the deformation zone on the northwest side of the storm system. Snowfall rates in some of the bands were an inch per hour, with visibility reduced to about one-quarter mile. Some specific snowfall totals included: 7 inches in Hardin County (2 miles northwest of Elizabethtown), 7 inches in southwest Gallatin County (at Leamington), 6 inches in Pope County (5 miles north of Golconda), 3 inches at Cairo, and 2.5 inches at Harrisburg. Following the ending of the snow, strong north winds gusting from 30 to 40 mph caused widespread drifting. The drifts were especially deep in open farm country, where the lack of trees and other obstructions resulted in stronger winds. The winter storm was caused by a deepening 500 mb trough that swung eastward from the Plains across the Mississippi Valley early on the 22nd. A weak low pressure center formed over Texas early on the 21st. The low gradually strengthened as it moved northeast across Alabama early on the 22nd, reaching the Virginia coast early on the 23rd.  The low pressure system was accompanied by plenty of Gulf of Mexico moisture, which pivoted as far northwest as southeast Illinois. There was sufficient cold air in place for most of the precipitation to fall as snow.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A combination of heavy wet snow and strong winds during the morning hours produced major impacts in parts of southern Illinois. About 4 inches of heavy wet snow fell north and west of a line from Mount Vernon to Murphysboro, including most of Perry County. The highest impacts were in Perry and Jefferson Counties, where scattered power outages occurred. More than 3,000 people lost power in Jefferson County alone. A church in Mount Vernon opened as a shelter for those without power or heat. Sustained north winds ranged from 20 to 30 mph, with gusts up to 40 mph. The peak wind gust at the Carbondale airport was 40 mph. A few trees were uprooted in Perry County, causing spotty power outages in Du Quoin and Pinckneyville. To the southeast, from 1 to 3 inches of snow fell as far southeast as a line from Fairfield to Marion to Anna. The snow fell heavily for a few hours, reducing visibility as low as one-quarter mile at the Carbondale airport. Roads were very slick and hazardous. Dozens of cars slid off roads in Jefferson County alone. Temperatures were from 32 to 34 degrees, which resulted in a heavy, wet snowfall. Specific snowfall reports included: 4 inches at Pinckneyville, 4 inches on the Jackson/Randolph County line near Campbell Hill, 3.5 inches at Dix (just north of Mount Vernon), 2 inches at Mount Vernon, 2 to 3 inches at Marion, and 1.5 inches at Anna (in Union County). This heavy precipitation event was caused by a couple of weak surface lows that consolidated into a strong low pressure center over western Kentucky. At 500 mb, the phasing of a northern stream shortwave over the northern Plains with a moist southern stream shortwave over Texas resulted in a deep low over the Lower Ohio Valley. North and west of the low track, rain transitioned to snow very late at night and continued through the morning.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A combination of heavy wet snow and strong winds during the morning hours produced major impacts in parts of southern Illinois. About 4 inches of heavy wet snow fell north and west of a line from Mount Vernon to Murphysboro, including most of Perry County. The highest impacts were in Perry and Jefferson Counties, where scattered power outages occurred. More than 3,000 people lost power in Jefferson County alone. A church in Mount Vernon opened as a shelter for those without power or heat. Sustained north winds ranged from 20 to 30 mph, with gusts up to 40 mph. The peak wind gust at the Carbondale airport was 40 mph. A few trees were uprooted in Perry County, causing spotty power outages in Du Quoin and Pinckneyville. To the southeast, from 1 to 3 inches of snow fell as far southeast as a line from Fairfield to Marion to Anna. The snow fell heavily for a few hours, reducing visibility as low as one-quarter mile at the Carbondale airport. Roads were very slick and hazardous. Dozens of cars slid off roads in Jefferson County alone. Temperatures were from 32 to 34 degrees, which resulted in a heavy, wet snowfall. Specific snowfall reports included: 4 inches at Pinckneyville, 4 inches on the Jackson/Randolph County line near Campbell Hill, 3.5 inches at Dix (just north of Mount Vernon), 2 inches at Mount Vernon, 2 to 3 inches at Marion, and 1.5 inches at Anna (in Union County). This heavy precipitation event was caused by a couple of weak surface lows that consolidated into a strong low pressure center over western Kentucky.

The roof of a home lost some shingles and a few pine trees were broken off in this area.  The tornado tracked across mainly open fields and crossed I-72 just east of Farmingdale Road at 7:45 PM CDT.  The tornado continued northeastward and damaged a house along Bunker Hill Road, blowing out windows, removing shingles, and breaking several trees.  It then caused minor shingle damage to a home along Emerson Road about a quarter mile south of Iles Avenue.  Further northeast, the tornado caused significant damage to a home along Iles Avenue about a half mile east of the intersection with Emerson Road, removing most of the roof and blowing out a wall on the west side of the structure.  Across the street, a barn lost its roof and several trees were snapped off.  The tornado then dissipated in an open field 6.6 miles west-southwest of Springfield at 7:50 PM CDT.",

The line was located to the south of a quasi-stationary front in a moist air mass, with surface dew points in the mid to upper 60's. Surface temperatures in the lower 80's contributed to moderate instability, which helped to maintain the line of storms into the early evening. Damaging winds and marginally severe hail accompanied the strongest storms.",

Moderately strong deep-layer wind shear resulted in organized clusters of multi-cells with large hail and isolated wind damage. Flash flooding of streets was also reported in a few cities. A secondary line of storms arrived late in the evening and then crossed much of southern Illinois overnight. This line included a bowing line segment that produced isolated wind damage.

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "A funnel cloud crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky, then touched down on the southwest edge of Metropolis a few blocks from the Ohio River. The most significant damage occurred along a residential street next to the city's elementary school. The school had window and roofing damage. The primary school received more serious structural damage, likely in excess of 100,000 dollars. Nearby homes sustained roof damage, and numerous large trees were uprooted or snapped. Power poles were down. The city fire department responded to six fire calls and three medical calls directly related to the storm. A tree fell on a car, resulting in minor injuries to the driver. On the east edge of Metropolis, the tornado ripped the roof off of a maintenance shed. The tornado moved through Fort Massac State Park and exited the park on U.S. Highway 45 just west of Interstate 24. A motel just west of the interstate sustained minor to moderate roof damage. The path ended near the intersection of Highway 45 and I-24. A photograph was taken of the funnel cloud over Metropolis, but the bottom part of the funnel was behind trees and buildings. Widespread power outages lasted for at least 12 hours. Peak winds were estimated near 105 mph.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A line of thunderstorms intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and began to bow out toward the east. Numerous damaging wind events occurred in the southern tip of Illinois, along with an isolated tornado. Wind damage was much more isolated to the north. The storms increased in strength ahead of a small-scale 500 mb shortwave over western Missouri. A moderately strong southwest wind flow of moist and very unstable air fueled the storms. Mixed-layer capes around 3000 j/kg fed into the southern end of the line of storms. Precipitable water values were near 2 inches. Earlier in the day, a weakening line of storms moved southward across southern Illinois. This line of storms produced isolated wind damage in Wabash County. The outflow boundary from this early line of storms provided a focus for the eastward-moving line in the afternoon.",

The line of storms produced numerous reports of wind damage, mainly along and north of a line from Carbondale to Carmi. The damage consisted mostly of downed trees and power lines, as well as minor roof damage. The line of storms occurred in a hot and humid air mass to the south of a cold front over the Upper Mississippi Valley. A weak 500 mb shortwave trough over Illinois provided support for thunderstorm development. Winds through the lower levels of the atmosphere were westerly at 30 to 40 knots, which was sufficient for organized wind damage.",

A weak 500 mb shortwave trough over Illinois provided support for thunderstorm development.

Some locations reported more than 3.00 inches of rain between 1700 and 1800 CST. Numerous city streets in Springfield were closed due to the flooding, including all of the roads in the vicinity of the Illinois State Fairgrounds where the annual State Fair was starting. A total of 58 camper trailers and 25 vehicles were damaged on the State Fairgrounds, where nearly 50 people were rescued in the camping area. No injuries were reported. Many livestock buildings were flooded, the Grandstand concert was cancelled, and fair officials closed the entrance/exit gates to keep people from leaving due to the extensive street flooding. In other areas of Springfield, 48 water rescues were made on city streets and viaducts by first responders, with no injuries reported. In other parts of the county, rural roads north of Springfield toward Cantrall, and west of Springfield toward New Berlin were impassable. State Highways 4, 29, 97 and 125 were also closed in spots due to flowing water and flooding. Due to the extent of the flooding and additional rainfall up to 1.00 inch in some locations, many roads remained flooded into the early morning hours of August 13th.",

A sub-tropical low pressure system that produced torrential rains along the Gulf of Mexico coast then turned north, eventually getting pulled northeast across Missouri along the stalled cold front. This low brought copious amounts of moisture. Showers and isolated thunderstorms brought torrential downpours between the 13th and 17th.

Damage began on Credit Island, and extended through downtown Davenport, the Village of East Davenport, Bettendorf, and into rural northeast Scott County. The tornado crossed the Mississippi River south of Princeton, Iowa and continued into Illinois, hitting Cordova, Illinois before lifting. Along the path, damage was primarily to trees and outbuildings. Some trees fell on homes and cars. In downtown Davenport, the roof of the jail and the roof of a homeless shelter were also damaged. Peak winds were estimated to be 100 mph. The widest portion of the path occurred in eastern Davenport/Village of East Davenport.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Low pressure brought strong thunderstorms over Iowa and Illinois the evening of October 6th, 2016. Just ahead of the low's path, a warm front was positioned over Iowa and Illinois near Interstate 80. This allowed for winds supporting tornadoes to develop with the strongest storms. A cluster of strong to severe storms moved from southeast Iowa northeast into Rock Island county, with several areas of damaging winds and tornadoes along the path from around the Quad Cities to Cordova, Illinois.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Severe drought conditions spread into the southern tip of Illinois, primarily the Metropolis area. Moderate drought conditions encompassed the remainder of southern Illinois south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line. A lack of precipitation caused soil moisture to decrease rapidly. Pasture land deteriorated, causing some farmers to begin feeding hay to livestock. Stock ponds began to run low. Some farmers began hauling in water for their livestock. Just across the state line, Paducah, Kentucky recorded its driest September-October combination on record. Only about one-quarter inch of rain fell during the first few weeks of November. This lack of precipitation, combined with above normal temperatures, contributed to the rapid onset of drought conditions. At Paducah, 1.28 inches of rain fell from September 1 to November 18. This was 8.69 inches below normal for that period. Small streams as well as larger rivers were running well below normal. Parts of the Ohio River were at 40 percent of normal flows. A heavy rainfall event late in the month brought some improvement in the drought.",

The airmass ahead of the front was unseasonably warm and humid with temperatures in the 70s and dewpoints of around 60 degrees.  In addition to the moderately strong instability, a vigorous short-wave trough approaching from the Central Plains enhanced low-level wind shear across the area.  Some of the resulting thunderstorms interacted with an old outflow boundary left behind by morning convection, further enhancing the available shear.  One of the most intense storms developed near Elmwood in Peoria County then tracked southeastward to Morton in Tazewell County.  This particular cell produced copious amounts of large hail, accumulating to several inches in some locations.  Nearly $3 million worth of damage was done as a result of wind-driven large hail across Peoria County.",
