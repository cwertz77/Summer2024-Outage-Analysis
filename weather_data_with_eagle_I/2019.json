This was in response to surface low pressure that developed across the Texas and Oklahoma region. This low then moved east-northeastward across the Missouri Bootheel by early evening on the 12th. Warmer temperatures at the surface and aloft gradually changed the precipitation to rain from south to north. The changeover occurred during the overnight hours of the 11th through the morning of the 12th. Sleet was not widespread enough to significantly lower snowfall amounts. The heaviest snowfall amounts from this system were from the Marion/Carbondale area north and west. The highest amount was 7 inches at Pinckneyville (Perry County). Amounts from 4 to 6 inches were the norm from the Marion/Carbondale area up to Mount Vernon. Amounts tapered down to an inch or two along the Ohio River from Cairo to Metropolis. There were significant travel impacts during the evening hours and into the overnight hours, as snow-covered roads led to numerous accidents. Portions of I-57 and I-64 were closed for a period of time in southern Illinois. At least 10 to 15 vehicles slid off roads in Johnson County. Snowfall rates were near an inch per hour during the evening of the 11th in some areas. At Desoto in Jackson County, 3.5 inches fell in three hours.",

The changeover occurred during the overnight hours of the 11th through the morning of the 12th. Sleet was not widespread enough to significantly lower snowfall amounts. The heaviest snowfall amounts from this system were from the Marion/Carbondale area north and west. The highest amount was 7 inches at Pinckneyville (Perry County). Amounts from 4 to 6 inches were the norm from the Marion/Carbondale area up to Mount Vernon. Amounts tapered down to an inch or two along the Ohio River from Cairo to Metropolis. There were significant travel impacts during the evening hours and into the overnight hours, as snow-covered roads led to numerous accidents. Portions of I-57 and I-64 were closed for a period of time in southern Illinois. At least 10 to 15 vehicles slid off roads in Johnson County.

This was in response to surface low pressure that developed across the Texas and Oklahoma region. This low then moved east-northeastward across the Missouri Bootheel by early evening on the 12th. Warmer temperatures at the surface and aloft gradually changed the precipitation to rain from south to north. The changeover occurred during the overnight hours of the 11th through the morning of the 12th. Sleet was not widespread enough to significantly lower snowfall amounts. The heaviest snowfall amounts from this system were from the Marion/Carbondale area north and west. The highest amount was 7 inches at Pinckneyville (Perry County). Amounts from 4 to 6 inches were the norm from the Marion/Carbondale area up to Mount Vernon. Amounts tapered down to an inch or two along the Ohio River from Cairo to Metropolis. There were significant travel impacts during the evening hours and into the overnight hours, as snow-covered roads led to numerous accidents. Portions of I-57 and I-64 were closed for a period of time in southern Illinois. At least 10 to 15 vehicles slid off roads in Johnson County. Snowfall rates were near an inch per hour during the evening of the 11th in some areas. At Desoto in Jackson County, 3.5 inches fell in three hours.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A deepening low pressure center tracked from eastern Arkansas across middle Tennessee during the day, then into southeast Kentucky on the evening of the 19th.  As colder air quickly pushed southward, rain changed to snow during the afternoon  hours. Travel impacts were very high due to the combination of high snowfall rates (1 to 2 inches per hour), strong wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, and rapidly falling temperatures. Roads quickly became snow and ice covered, and visibility was frequently below one-quarter mile for a few hours. Near blizzard conditions were  experienced in many areas for a few hours. There were numerous accidents, and some roads were closed for a while during the heart of the event. I-57 in southern Illinois was among the worst hit, which caused the Illinois State Police to close the interstate from Mount Vernon to Marion on the evening of the 19th. The heaviest snowfall totals were observed along a corridor from the Marion-Carbondale area northeast across Mcleansboro to Mt. Carmel. Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches occurred in this corridor, with pockets of 6 to 8 inches from Marion to southwest Hamilton County.  Across the extreme southeast counties of Hardin, Pope, and Massac, snowfall amounts were mainly from 1 to 3 inches. Measuring the snowfall accurately was a challenge due to the strong winds throughout the afternoon and evening hours. Drifting of the snow hindered travel. Convective elements, including thundersnow, produced snowfall rates from one to two inches per hour. Peak wind gusts were measured up to 52 mph at the Carbondale airport and 40 mph at the Carmi airport. Temperatures fell into the mid 20's by the end of the snowstorm, producing wind chills from 10 to 15.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A deepening low pressure center tracked from eastern Arkansas across middle Tennessee during the day, then into southeast Kentucky on the evening of the 19th.  As colder air quickly pushed southward, rain changed to snow during the afternoon  hours. Travel impacts were very high due to the combination of high snowfall rates (1 to 2 inches per hour), strong wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, and rapidly falling temperatures. Roads quickly became snow and ice covered, and visibility was frequently below one-quarter mile for a few hours. Near blizzard conditions were  experienced in many areas for a few hours. There were numerous accidents, and some roads were closed for a while during the heart of the event. I-57 in southern Illinois was among the worst hit, which caused the Illinois State Police to close the interstate from Mount Vernon to Marion on the evening of the 19th. The heaviest snowfall totals were observed along a corridor from the Marion-Carbondale area northeast across Mcleansboro to Mt. Carmel. Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches occurred in this corridor, with pockets of 6 to 8 inches from Marion to southwest Hamilton County.  Across the extreme southeast counties of Hardin, Pope, and Massac, snowfall amounts were mainly from 1 to 3 inches. Measuring the snowfall accurately was a challenge due to the strong winds throughout the afternoon and evening hours. Drifting of the snow hindered travel. Convective elements, including thundersnow, produced snowfall rates from one to two inches per hour. Peak wind gusts were measured up to 52 mph at the Carbondale airport and 40 mph at the Carmi airport. Temperatures fell into the mid 20's by the end of the snowstorm, producing wind chills from 10 to 15.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A deepening low pressure center tracked from eastern Arkansas across middle Tennessee during the day, then into southeast Kentucky on the evening of the 19th.  As colder air quickly pushed southward, rain changed to snow during the afternoon  hours. Travel impacts were very high due to the combination of high snowfall rates (1 to 2 inches per hour), strong wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, and rapidly falling temperatures. Roads quickly became snow and ice covered, and visibility was frequently below one-quarter mile for a few hours. Near blizzard conditions were  experienced in many areas for a few hours. There were numerous accidents, and some roads were closed for a while during the heart of the event. I-57 in southern Illinois was among the worst hit, which caused the Illinois State Police to close the interstate from Mount Vernon to Marion on the evening of the 19th. The heaviest snowfall totals were observed along a corridor from the Marion-Carbondale area northeast across Mcleansboro to Mt. Carmel. Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches occurred in this corridor, with pockets of 6 to 8 inches from Marion to southwest Hamilton County.  Across the extreme southeast counties of Hardin, Pope, and Massac, snowfall amounts were mainly from 1 to 3 inches. Measuring the snowfall accurately was a challenge due to the strong winds throughout the afternoon and evening hours. Drifting of the snow hindered travel. Convective elements, including thundersnow, produced snowfall rates from one to two inches per hour. Peak wind gusts were measured up to 52 mph at the Carbondale airport and 40 mph at the Carmi airport. Temperatures fell into the mid 20's by the end of the snowstorm, producing wind chills from 10 to 15.",

As colder air quickly pushed southward, rain changed to snow during the afternoon  hours. Travel impacts were very high due to the combination of high snowfall rates (1 to 2 inches per hour), strong wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, and rapidly falling temperatures. Roads quickly became snow and ice covered, and visibility was frequently below one-quarter mile for a few hours. Near blizzard conditions were  experienced in many areas for a few hours. There were numerous accidents, and some roads were closed for a while during the heart of the event. I-57 in southern Illinois was among the worst hit, which caused the Illinois State Police to close the interstate from Mount Vernon to Marion on the evening of the 19th. The heaviest snowfall totals were observed along a corridor from the Marion-Carbondale area northeast across Mcleansboro to Mt. Carmel. Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches occurred in this corridor, with pockets of 6 to 8 inches from Marion to southwest Hamilton County.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An Arctic cold front plunged through central Illinois on January 29th, bringing a bitterly cold airmass into the region.  Temperatures bottomed out on the morning of January 30th when readings ranged from 15 below to 25 below zero everywhere north of the I-70 corridor.  Record lows were observed at many sites, including 20 below zero at Peoria, 19 below zero at Lincoln, and a record-tying 14 below zero at Springfield.  In addition, strong northwesterly winds gusting 25-35mph created dangerous wind chill readings of 40 to 50 below zero.  Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington logged their all-time coldest wind chill of 53 below zero on the morning of the 30th.  Winds gradually eased as the day progressed: however, actual air temperatures remained below zero along and north of I-72.  With light winds and fresh snow cover, low temperatures once again fell into the teens below zero by the early morning of January 31st, with Peoria establishing a new record low for the date of 19 below zero.  Temperatures finally warmed above zero by the afternoon of the 31st, but didn't substantially warm until February 1st when readings climbed well into the 20s and lower 30s.||Due to the historic cold outbreak, the governor of Illinois declared a State of Emergency.  Hundreds of schools, colleges, and universities were closed.  Illinois state offices were closed and the postal service cancelled service across much of west-central Illinois.  AMTRAK suspended normal services as well.  A water main leak in downtown Peoria caused the closure of City Hall.  More than 500 customers lost power across portions of Peoria and Tazewell County for several hours on the morning of the 30th...mainly impacting the town of Hopedale.  Illinois State Police transported 21 people from a broken down charter bus on I-55 in extreme southern Sangamon County to a nearby restaurant for warmth.  In addition, frost quakes were reported during the peak of the cold at various locations around central Illinois.||One person died due to cold exposure during this event...an 82 year-old man in Marquette Heights.",

There was extensive flooding of low-lying woods, fields, and parks. Through February, the impacts were very similar to the March, 1997 flood. Most of the flood gates were installed at Cairo. Areas not protected by the levee and floodwall system were inundated. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a high-capacity pump near Urbandale to remove water from heavy rainfall on the protected side of the levee.

Metropolis is not protected by a levee or flood wall, so river floodwater impacted the city directly. Heavy rainfall events combined with backwater from the Ohio River caused widespread flooding along the eastern limits of Metropolis. Numerous roads were closed around the county. In the city of Metropolis, portions of 27 city streets were closed. The governor of Illinois toured the flooded area. The riverboat casino in Metropolis was closed for an extended period of time. Outside the city limits, 17 to 20 additional homes were affected in the county. About six of those homes were flooded. At least three water rescues were conducted. The Red Cross opened a shelter in Brookport. Floodgates were installed around Brookport, blocking access to the city from the east.",

The flood of Spring, 2011 remains the highest crest since 1937. Flood stage at Cairo is 40 feet. U.S. Highway 60/62 was closed at the Ohio River bridge to Kentucky. This road serves as a primary link between Kentucky and Illinois. A detour of about 80 miles was required for commuters in the area. The governor of Illinois surveyed the flooded part of the county. There was extensive flooding of low-lying woods, fields, and parks. The impacts were very similar to the March, 1997 flood. Most of the flood gates were installed at Cairo. Areas not protected by the levee and floodwall system were inundated. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed a high-capacity pump near Urbandale to remove water from heavy rainfall on the protected side of the levee.

More details on the flood crest and on the total property damage estimates can be found in the February report. Metropolis is not protected by a levee or flood wall, so river floodwater impacted the city directly. Heavy rainfall events combined with backwater from the Ohio River caused widespread flooding along the eastern limits of Metropolis. Numerous roads were closed around the county. In the city of Metropolis, portions of 27 city streets were closed. The governor of Illinois toured the flooded area. The riverboat casino in Metropolis was closed for an extended period of time. Outside the Metropolis city limits, 17 to 20 additional homes were affected in the county. About six of those homes were flooded.  The Red Cross opened a shelter in Brookport.

The highest accumulations were from the Marion-Carbondale area east along Route 13 to the Harrisburg area, where 1.5 to two inches of snow fell. There was some sleet mixed with the snow. To the north and south of the Carbondale to Harrisburg corridor, accumulations were mostly an inch or less. The precipitation partially melted on paved surfaces. Travel impacts were light due to the partial melting, as well as the timing of the event during the late night and early Sunday morning hours. A weak low pressure system over the southeastern United States spread moisture northwestward, while Arctic high pressure over the northern Plains funneled cold air into the lower Ohio Valley.",

A series of three heavy rainfall events caused river levels to rise. The first round of heavy rain occurred from the 11th to the 14th, followed by a second round from the 18th to the 20th, and another round from the 23rd to the 25th.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Extensive flooding occurred late May and into June across eastern Iowa, northwest Illinois, and northeast Missouri. The last half of May was very wet with 5-8 inches of rain falling over the region. This combined with saturated soils, brought many rivers above Moderate to Major flood levels. Many climate sites only saw 3 days of no precipitation from May 16th to May 31st. |The Wapsipinicon, Iowa, Skunk, Des Moines, Rock, and Green Rivers all recorded a preliminary Top 10 crest on record. The main stem Mississippi also crested again in late May / early June, with sites from Le Claire LD 14 on downstream recording a Top 10 crest. |Several significant flood events also occurred in March - Early May 2019 due to snowmelt, heavy rain, and saturated soil.",

Storms developed along the cold front as it pushed southeastward through Missouri. The significant low level wind produced storms favorable for hail and tornadoes.",

This was the most prolonged flood on the Ohio River since records began at Cairo in the late 1800's. The highest recorded stage in the month of June (2019) was 51.54 feet, which corresponds to the moderate flood category. At this stage, the flooding has a significant impact on farming operations in the flood plain, causing some farmers to lose crops. However, farmers never were able to plant crops because this flood began in the winter. Riverside parks and recreational facilities remained underwater. Some side roads near the river were flooded. Due to the extended duration of the flooding, levees along the river were very stressed from saturation of the soil. Seepage was a concern, and relief wells caused water to rise on the land side of the levees. Moderate flooding continued into the month of July.",

Backwater from the Mississippi kept moderate flooding going on the lowest reaches of the Ohio River as well as the Big Muddy River. The flooding on the Wabash and Little Wabash Rivers was minor. The region remained stuck in a long-term wet pattern that continued through the spring and into early summer. Most locations were 1 to 2 inches above normal for the month of June. Some locations saw as much as 3 to 5 inches more rainfall than normal in June. At Evansville, Indiana, it was the 6th wettest June on record with a total of 7.53 inches.",

After rising above flood stage in mid March, the Mississippi River remained above flood stage through the spring and into early summer. At the Thebes river gage, the river crested at 43.66 feet on June 10. This is considered a major flood. Major flooding starts at 42 feet. The East Cape Girardeau area was particularly hard hit, with some residences flooded for weeks. The Route 146 bridge connecting Illinois and Missouri at Cape Girardeau was closed due to flooding on the Illinois side of Route 146. Illinois Route 3 was flooded and closed for an extended period of time from Thebes north to East Cape Girardeau. A break in the Len Small Levee that occurred during the record flood of 2016 was not adequately repaired. This prolonged major flood enlarged the break in the levee, causing large parts of the Miller City area to flood. Several evacuated families were unable to reach their homes due to the flooding and road washouts. In the Miller City area, large sections of roads were washed away. The county highway engineer estimated damage to roads was well over one million dollars. A sewage plant at Thebes was inundated with floodwater and shut down, causing the community to be without sewer services. The Thebes Landing area of town was flooded. There was widespread flooding of low-lying farmland and woods across the county. Since some crop planting was not possible due to prolonged spring flooding, direct crop losses were reduced. The extended duration of the flooding caused levees to become unstable, and seepage became a problem. The governor of Illinois issued a disaster proclamation for the affected counties along the river.",

First responders were able to rescue the driver, a young female. The second water rescue involved a vehicle in the Trail of Tears State Forest near Ware. The vehicle was swept off State Forest Road where it crosses Clear Creek. Two people were in the vehicle at the time it was swept off the road. The male involved was able to escape. The body of the other person in the vehicle, a female in her late 50's, was found deceased the following morning less than a mile downstream from the vehicle. Elsewhere in the area, one lane of Highway 146 near the intersection of Highway 3 was flooded. A trained spotter reported 4.0 inches of rainfall in 24 hours three miles east of Ware. The public reported 4.5 inches of rain in 24 hours at Cobden.",

The main impact associated with these storms was flash flooding. Several locations picked up torrential rainfall amounts over a short time period. Over four inches of rain occurred in Union County, prompting water rescues from vehicles. Damaging winds up to around 60 mph occurred with a few of the storms as well. The environment was characterized by moderate to strong instability and moderate wind shear. Effective bulk wind shear values of 25 to 40 knots were observed. The storms developed east of a weak low pressure center over Missouri.",

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Widespread wind damage was reported in parts of southern Illinois, especially in far southern areas from the Marion-Carbondale area southward to the Ohio River. Flash flooding was reported in a few locations. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots.

A 500 mb shortwave trough over the western high Plains provided some additional support for the storms. The air mass was strongly unstable, with surface capes over 3000 j/kg.",

While the crest was among the ten highest on record, the extended duration of the flood played an even greater role on the impact. The combination of seepage and relief wells along the levees permitted large amounts of water to seep into normally dry areas. The biggest impacts in Alexander County were weeks after the river crested. Portions of Illinois Routes 3 and 146 were flooded and closed from the East Cape Girardeau area down to Thebes. A number of residences were flooded in McClure and East Cape Girardeau. Further south, the breach in the Len Small levee continued to permit large amounts of water into the Miller City area. A U.S. Geological Survey measurement determined that at least 20 percent of the total Mississippi River flow was exiting through the break in the Len Small levee. County roads and swaths of cropland were damaged extensively by fast-flowing water around the levee break. Six barges passed through the levee break and became stuck on Miller City Road. The loose barges damaged irrigation pivots and farm equipment. The river fell below flood stage late in the month, permitting more accurate damage assessments to take place.",

The survey determined that a microburst with peak winds near 85 mph occurred, along with a brief gustnado. The damage path was about 0.6 miles long and 850 yards wide. The gustnado, which is a non-tornadic circulation not connected to the cloud base, was videotaped. The damage consisted of dozens of downed tree limbs and a couple of downed trees. An attached carport was blown from the front of a house. Another house lost several shingles. Two crated four-wheelers were blown over, and a utility trailer was blown over 50 yards. At least one power pole was broken. The gustnado was indicated within the damage along the southeast side of the damage, both by video and within the damage pattern.",

A moist and moderately to strongly unstable air mass supported locally damaging winds. Weak deep-layer shear and modest mid-level lapse rates tempered the overall organization of the storms.",

A truck roof was dented, and there were some minor dents in cars. A window was broken out of a tractor cab. A few lights were knocked out. Some crop damage occurred north of Galatia. A local emergency manager and insurance agent confirmed that damage reports were scant. This may be attributable to the very sparse population of the area.

The tornado was at its widest and strongest in the latter half of its path.  Estimated peak winds for this tornado were 90 mph.  A one mile stretch between the last damage point and the Lake Michigan shore was unable to be surveyed due a nature area in the Illinois Beach Nature Preserve.  A waterspout was reported just off shore and so by interpolation, the path for this tornado was continued to the Lake Michigan shore.",

Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches, with the highest amounts observed along and north of Interstate 64 as well as northern Perry County. A robust surge of arctic air blasted into the region during the afternoon hours. The colder temperatures caused the rain to change to a brief period of sleet or freezing rain, before quickly transitioning to snow. The changeover occurred around noon near Mount Vernon and progressed to the Ohio River during the afternoon. Flash freeze conditions were observed on area roadways as gusty northwest winds accompanied the temperature drop into the 20s. Although road surface temperatures were well above freezing at the start, travel impacts quickly occurred as sunset approached. Many area roads became slick and hazardous, which resulted in numerous accidents and slide-offs. Portions of I-57 and I-24 were temporarily closed during the evening hours. The poor road conditions continued into the next morning due to very cold temperatures down into the teens, which caused icy patches on any untreated roads. A record low of 15 was established in Paducah, Kentucky, and Evansville, Indiana set a record low of 13. Wind chills were down around 0, and even below zero in several locations. The wintry weather was caused by a combination of systems. A strong cold front sagged slowly southeast across the lower Ohio Valley as an upper-level disturbance swung southeast from the Canadian prairie provinces.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A rare early season winter weather event occurred on Veterans Day. Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches, with the highest amounts observed along and north of Interstate 64 as well as northern Perry County. A robust surge of arctic air blasted into the region during the afternoon hours. The colder temperatures caused the rain to change to a brief period of sleet or freezing rain, before quickly transitioning to snow. The changeover occurred around noon near Mount Vernon and progressed to the Ohio River during the afternoon. Flash freeze conditions were observed on area roadways as gusty northwest winds accompanied the temperature drop into the 20s. Although road surface temperatures were well above freezing at the start, travel impacts quickly occurred as sunset approached. Many area roads became slick and hazardous, which resulted in numerous accidents and slide-offs. Portions of I-57 and I-24 were temporarily closed during the evening hours. The poor road conditions continued into the next morning due to very cold temperatures down into the teens, which caused icy patches on any untreated roads. A record low of 15 was established in Paducah, Kentucky, and Evansville, Indiana set a record low of 13. Wind chills were down around 0, and even below zero in several locations. The wintry weather was caused by a combination of systems. A strong cold front sagged slowly southeast across the lower Ohio Valley as an upper-level disturbance swung southeast from the Canadian prairie provinces.",

Several waves of low pressure tracked along the boundary, bringing periods of wintry precipitation to the area.  Snow spread into central Illinois from southwest to northeast during the afternoon of December 15th, then continued through the evening before tapering off and temporarily coming to an end by the early morning of December 16th.  As another wave moved along the front, a second round of snow developed during the afternoon of the 16th...eventually ending as a period of light freezing rain.  Storm total snow accumulations were greatest just north of the I-70 corridor, where amounts of 6 to 9 inches were common from Shelbyville northeastward to Mattoon.  Snowfall decreased further north, with 2 to 3 inches occurring along the I-74 corridor.",
