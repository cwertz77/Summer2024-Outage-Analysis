The vehicle was found completely submerged in Cache River floodwaters. A volunteer fire and rescue squad located the vehicle and the body of the motorist. The body of the female motorist was found in a flooded field about 100 feet from the vehicle. It appeared she may have tried to turn around, and the vehicle ended up in a flooded ditch. The incident was reported by a tow-truck driver who towed a second vehicle out of the floodwater. The driver of the second vehicle got out safely, but the vehicle was almost completely submerged except for a small part of the top.",

A potent storm system lifted out of the Southwest during the first few days of the year. An area of low pressure opened up as it entered the southern Plains. Widespread moderate to heavy rain fell between the 2nd and 4th. One to three inch totals were common during this time period, with isolated reports between four and five inches.",

At O'Hare the liquid precipitation total of 0.87 on Sunday was a record for February 1st, exceeding the previous record of 0.77 measured during the Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011.  ||A tightening pressure gradient around the low center as it moved from central Illinois into central Indiana also supported strong and gusty northeast winds later Sunday afternoon into the evening, producing a period of blizzard to near blizzard conditions with gusts over 35 mph and visibilities around 1/4 mile or less in many locations.||Some of the highest storm total snow reports include:  22.0 inches near Lincolnshire (Lake); 21.5 inches in Oak Lawn (Cook); 20.8 inches in Elmhurst (DuPage); 18.0 inches near Harvard (McHenry); 17.5 inches near Marseilles (La Salle); 16.8 inches west of Plainfield (Kendall); 16.8 inches in Batavia (Kane); 16.5 inches near Lockport (Will); 15.9 inches in DeKalb (DeKalb); 15.3 inches in Paw Paw (Lee); 15.2 inches in Morris (Grundy); 14.5 inches near Bourbonnais (Kankakee); 14.4 inches near Rockford (Winnebago); 14.0 inches in Rochelle (Ogle); 12.0 inches in Belvidere (Boone); 7.6 inches near Ashkum (Iroquois); 7.0 inches in Paxton (Ford); and 6.5 inches in Dwight (Livingston).||Some of the strongest wind measurements include: 52 mph near Waukegan; 49 mph near Shorewood; 44 mph at Rockford Airport; 44 mph at DuPage Airport; 43 mph at Aurora Airport; 43 mph at Paxton; and 40 mph near La Salle.",

Very cold temperatures in the wake of the storm rendered salt ineffective, slowing down recovery efforts. A low pressure center tracked northeast from north Texas to northern Alabama.

Around one-quarter inch of ice glazed trees and power lines, on top of one-quarter to one-half inch of sleet. Roads became  ice-covered and very slippery, especially untreated back roads. Multiple vehicles slid off roadways in Perry County. Isolated power outages were reported, including about 20 homes in Benton. Approximately two or three dozen utility customers were without power in each of these three counties: Jackson, Union, and Pulaski. Small branches were broken or bent by the ice. Along and north of Interstate 64, sleet was the main type of precipitation. One to two inches of sleet accumulated in the Mount Vernon area. Several east-to-west bands of light to locally moderate precipitation advanced slowly northward in response to the arrival of warm, moist air in the low levels. Strengthening of a southerly low level jet occurred ahead of a 500 mb shortwave impulse emerging out of the central Plains. Convective enhancement of precipitation rates was observed, including some thundersleet west of the Mississippi River.",

The precipitation was mainly snow northwest of a line from Carbondale to Mount Carmel. A swath of heavy snow fell across Wayne and Jefferson Counties, including the Mount Vernon area. The co-operative observer near Mount Vernon measured 6.5 inches of snow. A trained spotter several miles south of Mount Erie in Wayne County measured 6 inches. Amounts tapered off toward the south. Only about 2 inches was reported near Pinckneyville and Du Quoin (in Perry County) and at Dahlgren (in Hamilton County). Along and southeast of a line from Carbondale to Mount Carmel, the precipitation was mainly in the form of light sleet and freezing drizzle. Amounts were generally one-tenth inch or less. Little if any wintry precipitation occurred in the southeast corner of the state, from Vienna south and east to the Ohio River. The precipitation was caused by a surge of warmer air aloft moving north across the region. The warmer air aloft moved over a shallow layer of cold air near the surface. As the depth of cold air decreased, the precipitation changed from snow to sleet and freezing rain, then finally to liquid rain or drizzle.",

Snowfall amounts increased from north to south, ranging from just a few inches along Interstate 64 to one foot along the Ohio River at Metropolis. Rain gradually changed over to snow during the day. A few hours of sleet and freezing rain occurred during the transition from rain to snow. Up to one-tenth inch of sleet and ice accumulated, followed by snow. The steadiest and heaviest snow was south and east of the Marion/Carbondale area, where visibility was occasionally below one-half mile in heavy snow. Snowfall rates were one to two inches per hour during the evening. Specific snowfall amounts included: 11 inches in Brookport and Mound City (both along the Ohio River), 8 inches in Anna (Union County), Carrier Mills (Saline County), and Cave-In-Rock (Hardin County), about 6 inches in the Marion/Carbondale area, 5 inches in Mount Carmel, 4 inches in Du Quoin (Perry County), and 2 inches in Mount Vernon. North winds gusted up to 25 mph, causing some drifting of the snow. Travel became very difficult. In far southern parts of the state, unplowed roads were impassable to smaller, lighter vehicles. Near Murphysboro, Illinois Route 149 was shut down due to several semis that could not climb a hill. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week in most counties. Just across the Ohio River in Paducah, Kentucky, there were 12.1 inches of snow, which was the heaviest March snowstorm on record for that location. It was also the third largest snowstorm for any time of the year at Paducah. Some of the coldest air ever recorded in the month of March invaded southern Illinois the day after the snowstorm, hampering snow removal efforts. The low temperature was 3  below zero at Carbondale on March 6. In the wake of a strong cold front that passed through on the night of the 3rd, an arctic high pressure center moved southeast into the central Plains. A deep 500 mb trough progressed slowly eastward from the Rockies across the Plains. This trough was responsible for a sustained period of moist southwest flow aloft.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A major winter storm dumped up to a foot of snow in southern Illinois. Snowfall amounts increased from north to south, ranging from just a few inches along Interstate 64 to one foot along the Ohio River at Metropolis. Rain gradually changed over to snow during the day. A few hours of sleet and freezing rain occurred during the transition from rain to snow. Up to one-tenth inch of sleet and ice accumulated, followed by snow. The steadiest and heaviest snow was south and east of the Marion/Carbondale area, where visibility was occasionally below one-half mile in heavy snow. Snowfall rates were one to two inches per hour during the evening. Specific snowfall amounts included: 11 inches in Brookport and Mound City (both along the Ohio River), 8 inches in Anna (Union County), Carrier Mills (Saline County), and Cave-In-Rock (Hardin County), about 6 inches in the Marion/Carbondale area, 5 inches in Mount Carmel, 4 inches in Du Quoin (Perry County), and 2 inches in Mount Vernon. North winds gusted up to 25 mph, causing some drifting of the snow. Travel became very difficult. In far southern parts of the state, unplowed roads were impassable to smaller, lighter vehicles. Near Murphysboro, Illinois Route 149 was shut down due to several semis that could not climb a hill. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week in most counties. Just across the Ohio River in Paducah, Kentucky, there were 12.1 inches of snow, which was the heaviest March snowstorm on record for that location. It was also the third largest snowstorm for any time of the year at Paducah.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A major winter storm dumped up to a foot of snow in southern Illinois. Snowfall amounts increased from north to south, ranging from just a few inches along Interstate 64 to one foot along the Ohio River at Metropolis. Rain gradually changed over to snow during the day. A few hours of sleet and freezing rain occurred during the transition from rain to snow. Up to one-tenth inch of sleet and ice accumulated, followed by snow. The steadiest and heaviest snow was south and east of the Marion/Carbondale area, where visibility was occasionally below one-half mile in heavy snow. Snowfall rates were one to two inches per hour during the evening. Specific snowfall amounts included: 11 inches in Brookport and Mound City (both along the Ohio River), 8 inches in Anna (Union County), Carrier Mills (Saline County), and Cave-In-Rock (Hardin County), about 6 inches in the Marion/Carbondale area, 5 inches in Mount Carmel, 4 inches in Du Quoin (Perry County), and 2 inches in Mount Vernon. North winds gusted up to 25 mph, causing some drifting of the snow. Travel became very difficult. In far southern parts of the state, unplowed roads were impassable to smaller, lighter vehicles. Near Murphysboro, Illinois Route 149 was shut down due to several semis that could not climb a hill. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week in most counties. Just across the Ohio River in Paducah, Kentucky, there were 12.1 inches of snow, which was the heaviest March snowstorm on record for that location. It was also the third largest snowstorm for any time of the year at Paducah.

The steadiest and heaviest snow was south and east of the Marion/Carbondale area, where visibility was occasionally below one-half mile in heavy snow. Snowfall rates were one to two inches per hour during the evening. Specific snowfall amounts included: 11 inches in Brookport and Mound City (both along the Ohio River), 8 inches in Anna (Union County), Carrier Mills (Saline County), and Cave-In-Rock (Hardin County), about 6 inches in the Marion/Carbondale area, 5 inches in Mount Carmel, 4 inches in Du Quoin (Perry County), and 2 inches in Mount Vernon. North winds gusted up to 25 mph, causing some drifting of the snow. Travel became very difficult. In far southern parts of the state, unplowed roads were impassable to smaller, lighter vehicles. Near Murphysboro, Illinois Route 149 was shut down due to several semis that could not climb a hill. Schools were closed for the remainder of the week in most counties. Just across the Ohio River in Paducah, Kentucky, there were 12.1 inches of snow, which was the heaviest March snowstorm on record for that location. It was also the third largest snowstorm for any time of the year at Paducah. Some of the coldest air ever recorded in the month of March invaded southern Illinois the day after the snowstorm, hampering snow removal efforts. The low temperature was 3  below zero at Carbondale on March 6. In the wake of a strong cold front that passed through on the night of the 3rd, an arctic high pressure center moved southeast into the central Plains. A deep 500 mb trough progressed slowly eastward from the Rockies across the Plains. This trough was responsible for a sustained period of moist southwest flow aloft. The relatively moist air overrunning cold air near the surface set the stage for widespread moderate to heavy snow.",

The combined effect of all these rain and snow events was a prolonged flooding event on the Ohio River.

At its strongest, peak winds were estimated to be 200 mph which occurred during this segment of the storm.  The tornado entered Ogle County just west of IL-38 and moved northeast where it ripped the roof off of a small barn.  A neighborhood was hit on S Skare Court where damage was consistent with EF-3.  Some of the homes had large sections of the roofs ripped off while some less well constructed homes (nails instead of bolts) had collapsed walls.  The tornado continued northeast and intensified to EF-4 where several well constructed homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were completely destroyed with the slab swept clean.  Several outbuildings were destroyed along East Hemstock Road and South Center Road.  A residence on East Bethal Road received heavy damage with most of the outer walls collapsing.  The tornado once again intensified to EF-4  near IL-251 and IL-64 where well constructed homes were swept clean off their foundation.  A farmstead just northeast of the aforementioned intersection was also swept clean to the foundation.  A heavy barn was thrown and rolled on East Lindenwood Road.  In total, around 30 homes were damaged or destroyed around Rochelle.  The tornado continued into Dekalb County just north of East Quarry Road.  (Tornado 2b of 7).",

Combined with robust wind shear, this helped to trigger these potent storms.  A long tracked violent tornado destroyed numerous homes and farmsteads along its path across north central Lee, eastern Ogle, northwest Dekalb, and southern Boone counties.  This path included the far northwest side of Rochelle, Interstate-39, and a direct hit in the community of Fairdale where two fatalities occurred.

The tornado entered the county just southwest of Fairdale before directly hitting the small community.  Peak winds were estimated at 165 mph in Dekalb County, rating this section of the tornado a high end EF-3.  Approximately 71 homes in the community had been damaged, 17 of which had been completely destroyed with all walls collapsed or removed from the buildings.  Some homes that were only nailed to the foundation were swept clean.  Two fatalities and 11 injuries occurred in Fairdale.  A 67-year-old woman and her neighbor, a 69-year-old woman, were both killed in their homes.  The tornado began to shift north (left) at this point during its lifecycle as it left Fairdale.  Several homes were heavily damaged with large sections of the roofs removed along Wheeler road and dozens of trees were snapped and uprooted.  A few trees were debarked.  The second story was ripped off of a home near the intersection of McNeal Road and Irene Road.  A two-story rebar reinforced cinder block silo was destroyed.  The tornado continued into Boone County just east of Irene Road.  (Tornado 2c of 7).",

The atmosphere was ripe for severe weather due to highly anomalous moisture and instability for early April across the region.  A strong low pressure system advanced into this favorable air mass. Combined with robust wind shear, this helped to trigger these potent storms.  A long tracked violent tornado destroyed numerous homes and farmsteads along its path across north central Lee, eastern Ogle, northwest Dekalb, and southern Boone counties.  This path included the far northwest side of Rochelle, Interstate-39, and a direct hit in the community of Fairdale where two fatalities occurred.  This was the strongest tornado in the NWS Chicago CWA since the F5 tornado that struck Plainfield, IL on August 28th, 1990.",

These storms produced hail as large as golf balls, damaging winds of 60 to 70 mph, and two tornadoes. The tornadoes touched down near Fulton and Thomson Illinois. Both tornadoes produced EF-1 damage to mainly trees and farm outbuildings.",

The atmosphere was ripe for severe weather due to highly anomalous moisture and instability for early April across the region.  A strong low pressure system advanced into this favorable air mass. Combined with robust wind shear, this helped to trigger these potent storms.  A long tracked violent tornado destroyed numerous homes and farmsteads along its path across north central Lee, eastern Ogle, northwest Dekalb, and southern Boone counties.  This path included the far northwest side of Rochelle, Interstate-39, and a direct hit in the community of Fairdale where two fatalities occurred.  This was the strongest tornado in the NWS Chicago CWA since the F5 tornado that struck Plainfield, IL on August 28th, 1990.",

The atmosphere was ripe for severe weather due to highly anomalous moisture and instability for early April across the region.  A strong low pressure system advanced into this favorable air mass. Combined with robust wind shear, this helped to trigger these potent storms.  A long tracked violent tornado destroyed numerous homes and farmsteads along its path across north central Lee, eastern Ogle, northwest Dekalb, and southern Boone counties.  This path included the far northwest side of Rochelle, Interstate-39, and a direct hit in the community of Fairdale where two fatalities occurred.  This was the strongest tornado in the NWS Chicago CWA since the F5 tornado that struck Plainfield, IL on August 28th, 1990.",

The atmosphere was ripe for severe weather due to highly anomalous moisture and instability for early April across the region.  A strong low pressure system advanced into this favorable air mass. Combined with robust wind shear, this helped to trigger these potent storms.  A long tracked violent tornado destroyed numerous homes and farmsteads along its path across north central Lee, eastern Ogle, northwest Dekalb, and southern Boone counties.  This path included the far northwest side of Rochelle, Interstate-39, and a direct hit in the community of Fairdale where two fatalities occurred.  This was the strongest tornado in the NWS Chicago CWA since the F5 tornado that struck Plainfield, IL on August 28th, 1990.",

Ample west-southwesterly deep-layer wind shear (from 40 to 45 knots) existed for sustained severe storms. The degree of low-level forcing along the front resulted in an extensive, broken squall line with embedded bowing structures.

In this location, it snapped a large tree off and took the roof off of a barn. The barn was shifted on its foundation. Also, an empty grain bin was destroyed and thrown a quarter of a mile to the northeast. It moved to the northeast and after it crossed County Road 950E, it broke off a number of large tree limbs from a stand of trees. As the tornado moved into the west side of Carrollton, it destroyed a small shed with 2x4s from it impaled into the house across the street. Numerous trees were either snapped or uprooted on the west and north sides of town. On 10th Street just south of South Main Street, a manufactured home lost its entire roof. Just a block northeast, a quarter of the roof of a metal Farm Services building was blown off. Also, the southeast corner of the building had the wall blown inward. A resale shop on the northside of Illinois Route 108 lost part of its metal roof. Further northeast, a number of trees were either snapped off or uprooted. Then the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 67 north of intersection with Parkview Drive. More tree damage occurred on County Road 1400N about seven tenths of a mile west of County Road 1250E. The tornado lifted and dissipated just north of County Road 1400N.  Overall, the tornado was rated EF1 with top wind speeds of 104 MPH. Max path width was 200 yards and the length was 4.68 miles.",

This rain resulted in widespread flash flooding, including the closure of a portion of I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway).  Across the metro area, there were reports and photos of cars stranded, though no injuries were reported to the NWS.  The heavy rainfall and widespread storm coverage resulted in the cancellation or delays of hundreds of commercial flights in and out of Chicago.  A downburst occurred in Mendota, Illinois with winds estimated to be around 80 mph resulting in mainly tree damage.  While the environment was not conducive for long-lived or powerful tornadoes, a tornado threat existed with a few supercells. This included two storms in central Cook County, primarily west of downtown Chicago. Each of these had funnel cloud reports.  There was also a tornado reported near the Will/Kanakakee County border, not far from I-57.  An EF-1 tornado was confirmed near Symerton Illinois.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the evening of June 22, twelve tornadoes occurred across northern Illinois, including ten in the WFO Chicago forecast area.  Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the evening of June 22, twelve tornadoes occurred across northern Illinois, including ten in the WFO Chicago forecast area.  Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.",

Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.",

At least one house was pushed off of its foundation.  Several trees fell onto recreational vehicles and it was estimated that around 100 of the 300 homes in the area received some degree of damage.  One person was taken to the hospital in serious condition, and six others were injured.  Peak winds were estimated to be 130 mph. (Tornado 3 of 10).",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the evening of June 22, twelve tornadoes occurred across northern Illinois, including ten in the WFO Chicago forecast area.  Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the evening of June 22, twelve tornadoes occurred across northern Illinois, including ten in the WFO Chicago forecast area.  Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.",

Rainfall amounts of 3.50 to 5.00 inches resulted from two separate rounds of storms - one in the late evening and one after Midnight. Extensive street flooding was reported in the town of Hoopeston. Most rural roads from Hoopeston to Rossville, and east to the Indiana border were impassable. The rainfall finally ended in the early morning hours, which allowed the flooding to subsided around daybreak on the 19th.",

A few of the storms produced hail as large as quarters: however, the main severe weather issue was heavy rainfall and flash flooding.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches were common along and north of a Lincoln to Danville line which lead to localized flash flooding, particularly in northern Vermilion County which was already saturated from flash flooding the previous two weeks.",

A large upper-level ridge became established over the eastern half of the country, while a large trough formed over the West. This set up a warm southwest flow that brought in copious amounts of moisture. The primary rainfall event that triggered the historic flooding was a swath of 6 to 12 inches across central Missouri from December 26 to 28. The axis of heaviest rainfall extended roughly along Interstate 44 in Missouri, then northeast into central Illinois.",

At the surface, an area of low pressure over northeast Kansas moved to central Wisconsin. A trailing cold front surged eastward through the Mid-Mississippi and Lower Ohio Valleys. The storms were fed by a broadening and strengthening southwesterly low-level jet, which destabilized the atmosphere ahead of the storms. The presence of strong low-level and deep-layer wind shear enhanced the risk of wind damage and tornadoes.",

Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.",

A family of 5 was traveling from Kentucky to Minnesota and somehow got lost after getting off of I-57. The family ended up about 2 miles southeast of Patoka, going north on Farthing Road. In the dark, the driver probably did not see the rushing water over the roadway before it was too late. The vehicle was carried about 150 to 200 feet downstream and became lodged in some trees. An occupant of the vehicle called 911 about 730 pm, but shortly after a firefighter arrived on the scene, the car became dislodged and sank.  Dive teams recovered the car from the water several hours later. All 5 occupants were pronounced dead from drowning just before midnight.  The flooding did not affect any structures in the area, just road flooding in a few locations. Also, this area of flooding was well removed from the axis of the heaviest rain that stretched from the eastern Ozarks into central Illinois.",

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.",

As Canadian high pressure moved north of the Great Lakes during the early morning of December 28th, northeasterly winds brought colder air into the region.  With temperatures falling into the upper 20s and lower 30s, rain changed to freezing rain along and north of a Canton to Bloomington line.  Although warm ground temperatures prevented much freezing on paved surfaces, significant ice accumulations of one tenth to three tenths of an inch were reported on elevated surfaces, including trees.  This amount of ice, combined with strong easterly winds gusting to between 40 and 50 mph, brought down many trees and power lines.  Due to the very wet soil conditions, numerous large trees were uprooted, damaging homes and taking down power lines and power poles.  Widespread power outages were reported in Galesburg, Peoria, Bloomington-Normal, and many smaller communities.  Around 240,000 people lost power across Knox, Stark, Marshall, Peoria, Tazewell, Woodford, and McLean counties.",

As Canadian high pressure moved north of the Great Lakes during the early morning of December 28th, northeasterly winds brought colder air into the region.  With temperatures falling into the upper 20s and lower 30s, rain changed to freezing rain along and north of a Canton to Bloomington line.  Although warm ground temperatures prevented much freezing on paved surfaces, significant ice accumulations of one tenth to three tenths of an inch were reported on elevated surfaces, including trees.  This amount of ice, combined with strong easterly winds gusting to between 40 and 50 mph, brought down many trees and power lines.  Due to the very wet soil conditions, numerous large trees were uprooted, damaging homes and taking down power lines and power poles.  Widespread power outages were reported in Galesburg, Peoria, Bloomington-Normal, and many smaller communities.  Around 240,000 people lost power across Knox, Stark, Marshall, Peoria, Tazewell, Woodford, and McLean counties.",

Numerous roads were flooded including Old State Route 158 between Illinois Routes 177 and 161 near Scott Air Force Base. In Cahokia, a large car lot on Camp Jackson Road was flooded. Water was over the hood of most of the vehicles.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A prolonged period of rainfall occurred from the early morning hours of December 26th to the evening of December 28th.  The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.",

The water was flowing over the road from a pond south of Route 161 to the lower ditches on the north side of the road. A school bus carrying a basketball team from Mount Vernon to Mascoutah for a game was carried off the road by the water. At the time it happened, approximately 545 pm on December 28th, there was about 6 inches of water of the road. A semi truck was also carried off the roadway in this area. In total, 18 people were rescued with no injuries reported.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A prolonged period of rainfall occurred from the early morning hours of December 26th to the evening of December 28th.  The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.",
