Across parts of northwest Illinois, temperatures were cold enough for the rain to fall as freezing rain.  A quarter inch of ice was reported on trees in Winnebago, in Winnebago County with a thin layer of ice on pavement and a quarter inch of ice was measured at Rockford Airport.  Another area of light freezing rain moved across northwest Illinois during the afternoon of January 11th with a light glaze reported in many areas.  The precipitation switched to snow with a quick 1 to 2 inches of snow accumulation during the evening.",

Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line.

Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line.

Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line. A weak surface low formed along a cold front over southwest Arkansas, then deepened as it tracked northeast across the Missouri Bootheel and into the lower Ohio Valley on the morning of the 11th.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An unseasonably strong storm system impacted the region January 10-11. Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line. A weak surface low formed along a cold front over southwest Arkansas, then deepened as it tracked northeast across the Missouri Bootheel and into the lower Ohio Valley on the morning of the 11th.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An unseasonably strong storm system impacted the region January 10-11. Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line. A weak surface low formed along a cold front over southwest Arkansas, then deepened as it tracked northeast across the Missouri Bootheel and into the lower Ohio Valley on the morning of the 11th.",

Surface low pressure moved across central Illinois during the late afternoon hours. High temperatures soared into the mid 80's in many locations, which helped to prime the atmosphere for severe thunderstorm development. Surface-based instability was quite strong. Very cold air aloft contributed to steep mid-level lapse rates near 8.5 C/km, very favorable for large hail. Small clusters of thunderstorms moved southeast across southern Illinois, producing scattered reports of large hail and gusty winds.",

Very cold air aloft contributed to steep mid-level lapse rates near 8.5 C/km, very favorable for large hail. Small clusters of thunderstorms moved southeast across southern Illinois, producing scattered reports of large hail and gusty winds.",

The tornado began around 10:16 pm CDT, and caused significant damage at a farmstead, with estimated maximum winds of 110 mph. The tornado nearly completely destroyed a 70 foot concrete silo, snapped the trunk of a large tree, completely destroyed two horse sheds, and damaged an equipment shed. The tornado then moved rapidly northeast along an intermittent four and a quarter mile path, and caused tree and outbuilding damage at two other farmsteads. The tornado lifted around 10:20 pm CDT. Times and begin/end locations were estimated by radar. Field assistance by the Henry County Emergency Manager and OEM volunteers to complete the remote survey is greatly appreciated.",

Flooding from the Chicago River also flooded all of Lower Wacker Drive which was closed.  Several cars were stalled in the flood waters and six homeless people were rescued.  Flooding from the Chicago River was reported to be the worst in nearly 60 years and flooded the basement lower levels of the Willis Tower.  The water had to recede and it took several days to pump water from the lower levels.  Power was lost which affected numerous TV and radio station broadcasts, including the NOAA Weather Radio Station which broadcasts from the Willis Tower.  The flow of the Chicago River was reversed to avoid overbank flooding, which allowed storm water and sewage to flow directly into Lake Michigan.  The Chicago Riverwalk was also flooded in several locations.",

Storms initially formed along and north of the Highway 30 corridor in eastern Iowa, produced widespread damage to crops in Buchanan and Delaware counties, and eventually went on to produce a wind gust near 60 mph at the Dubuque Regional Airport. Storms across this area eventually merged and slowed down, leading to localized rainfall amounts of 4-5 inches. This very heavy rainfall produced flash flooding in the Dubuque metro, with law enforcement reporting several road closures along Highway 20.|Storms continued to form along a line to the south through the mid afternoon, and reached the Mississippi River around 6-7 PM. Several reports of wind damage to trees were received from McDonough county to the Quad Cities metro area. A few reports of funnel clouds were also received from the Kirkwood, IL area, but no tornado was ever observed.",

These cells formed along the I-74 corridor and brought large hail and locally heavy rainfall during the late afternoon hours.  Hail as large as tennis balls or 2.5 inches in diameter was reported in Bartonville in Peoria County.  Meanwhile, hailstones as large as 2 inches in diameter caused considerable damage to car dealerships in Savoy and numerous roofs on the east side of Urbana in Champaign County.

A wind gust of 65 MPH was measured just west of Independence. The second round of thunderstorms developed as a result of an upper level disturbance interacting with an atmosphere characterized by extremely high instability with modest vertical wind shear. Activity initially formed in north central Iowa, producing golf ball to two inch hail from Fort Dodge to Waterloo Iowa. Eventually, storms made their way towards the Cedar Rapids/Iowa City metro areas, producing widespread wind damage and hail up to baseball size. These storms continued through the Quad Cities metro east towards Princeton, Sterling, and Hennepin Illinois, producing additional reports of wind damage and winds of 70 to 90 mph.

Activity initially formed in north central Iowa, producing golf ball to two inch hail from Fort Dodge to Waterloo Iowa. Eventually, storms made their way towards the Cedar Rapids/Iowa City metro areas, producing widespread wind damage and hail up to baseball size.

On video the tornado appeared to be multivortex and violent, yet damage in the St. Louis county warning area was limited to a few broken tree branches, flattened corn and the partial destruction of a small outbuilding. Therefore, it was rated as an EF-0 in Montgomery County with a path length of 3.89 miles and a max path width of 300 yards. The tornado continued north into Sangamon County (WFO Central IL CWA) before lifting and dissipating about 2.4 miles south of Divernon. Overall, the tornado was rated EF0 with a total path length of 4.24 miles and a max path width of 300 yards. No deaths or injuries were reported.",

A 500 mb disturbance over northwest Missouri moved east-southeast toward west central Illinois during the afternoon. An outflow boundary from morning storms was the focus for thunderstorm development in east central Missouri. These storms propagated southeast across southern Illinois in the evening, fed by a very warm and moist air mass. Partial sunshine resulted in a corridor of strong instability, with mixed layer cape approaching 3500 j/kg. Moderately strong winds aloft associated with the upper level disturbance contributed to the evolution of an organized storm cluster that crossed southwest Illinois in the evening. The storms slowed down later in the evening, resulting in persistent heavy rain and local flash flooding.",

At the country club, tree limbs and a medium sized tree were blown over. A wood fence surrounding a port-a-potty was blown over, and another port-a-potty was blown over. Nobody was occupying the port-a-potty at the time of the tornado. Peak winds were estimated at 65 to 75 mph based on damage photos.",

The storms produced very heavy rainfall, along with an isolated brief tornado. The storms formed along and ahead of a slow-moving frontal boundary that extended generally along the Ohio River into southeast Missouri. The environment near and south of the front was characterized by dew points in the lower to middle 70's and precipitable water values around 1.75 inches. With daytime heating, instability increased substantially to around 3000 J/kg south of the front, with a sharp gradient along the surface front.",

Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph.

Tree and power line damage occurred across 48 blocks of the village and structural damage occurred across 13 blocks.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in two mobile home parks and five people were injured.  At least 50 people were displaced.  Significant damage occurred to a large metal building near a gas station with associated debris blown toward the northeast.  The gas station had its heating and cooling unit ripped off the roof, leaving a hole in the roof.  A cinder block wall was blown out of the east side of a building causing minor damage to a parked semi truck.  A garage partially collapsed from a fallen tree.  Several other roofs suffered some damage from falling tree limbs.  A car was damaged by a falling tree limb.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

These strong winds damaged many trees, crops, and a few structures in their path.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A powerful line of severe thunderstorms produced a derecho which tracked across eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois on the afternoon of Monday, August 10th, resulting in widespread straight line wind damage. The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties. The Cedar Rapids area was particularly hard hit. One fatality occurred in Linn County, as a tree fell on a cyclist. Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph. Wind gusts of 80-100 mph were common as the line of storms moved through the Quad Cities area and then through northwest Illinois. A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped. In addition to the damage, numerous long-duration power outages occurred across the region. Damage to crops was considerable along the derecho path. Numerous semi trucks were also blown off roadways along the path of the derecho.",

The tornado ended near the intersection of Ferguson and Loomis Streets.  All of the damage was to trees along the tornado path.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.

This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.

This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "A tornado with peak winds of 100 mph touched just east of Harlem Avenue in Oak Forest then moved nearly due east along 151st Street producing tree damage and minor structural damage before lifting near the Interstate 57/294 interchange in Midlothian.  Numerous trees were uprooted between Ridgeland Avenue and Cicero Avenue.  The worst damage occurred between Cicero Avenue and Pulaski Road where several large trees and utility poles were snapped at their base.  Tree damage continued east of Pulaski Road with fences blown down before the tornado lifted.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the late morning through the afternoon of Monday August 10th, a line of intense thunderstorms known as a derecho brought widespread severe wind damage across Iowa, northern Illinois and northern Indiana.||In north central and northeast Illinois alone, the severe winds of 60 to 100 mph downed or damaged tens of thousands of trees, as well as caused severe damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.  There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.",

As a result, widespread wind damage was reported along and north of a Macomb...to Springfield...to Paris line.",

This led to strong baroclinicity along the front, and subsequent convection with just the right amount of instability. This is considered a high shear low CAPE (HSLC) event, where organized severe thunderstorms are favored in this environment. Potential hazards are damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. Six tornadoes were confirmed and several wind reports were received (ranging between 50-60 mph, with a few gusts over 60 mph). Damage reports ranged from structural damage to tree damage. Many residents were left without power in parts of northwestern IL, leading to some schools canceling classes on the 11th. Besides the strong winds, a few severe hail reports were received.||In addition, heavy rain occurred with some of the stronger storms, with rainfall totals over an inch. For how dry it has been, flash flooding was not much of a concern.

This led to strong baroclinicity along the front, and subsequent convection with just the right amount of instability. This is considered a high shear low CAPE (HSLC) event, where organized severe thunderstorms are favored in this environment. Potential hazards are damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. Six tornadoes were confirmed and several wind reports were received (ranging between 50-60 mph, with a few gusts over 60 mph). Damage reports ranged from structural damage to tree damage. Many residents were left without power in parts of northwestern IL, leading to some schools canceling classes on the 11th. Besides the strong winds, a few severe hail reports were received.||In addition, heavy rain occurred with some of the stronger storms, with rainfall totals over an inch. For how dry it has been, flash flooding was not much of a concern. While the environment was very moist and favorable for heavy rainfall, the fast storm motions led to little accumulation through much of our forecast area.",
