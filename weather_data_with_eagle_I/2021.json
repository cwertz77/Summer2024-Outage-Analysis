There was a brief lull in the precipitation in the early to mid afternoon and then a band of snow moved across the area, producing snowfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches.  A wintry mix continued into the early evening across parts of east central Illinois.||Several trees and power lines were brought down by the ice in Ford and Livingston counties with power outages reported.  At least a quarter inch of ice was reported 3 miles north of Crescent City and 7 miles north of Watseka, both in Iroquois County.

While the storm was supposed to lead to mostly snow for the northern half of our forecast area, those areas received mainly freezing rain and sleet through most of the afternoon. This led to widespread ice accumulations of 0.10-0.25.  This resulted in some downed tree limbs and power outages were a result.||Mid afternoon, the freezing rain began to switch to snow from a line around Iowa City, IA to Freeport, IL. Another band of snow set up just east of the Mississippi, where reports around 3 were noted in the Moline area.

This system moved in from the south and brought along a strong pull of warm air aloft. This led to a lot more ice accumulation than was expected prior to the event. While the storm was supposed to lead to mostly snow for the northern half of our forecast area, those areas received mainly freezing rain and sleet through most of the afternoon. This led to widespread ice accumulations of 0.10-0.25.  This resulted in some downed tree limbs and power outages were a result.||Mid afternoon, the freezing rain began to switch to snow from a line around Iowa City, IA to Freeport, IL. Another band of snow set up just east of the Mississippi, where reports around 3 were noted in the Moline area.

Some freezing rain was even measured as the transition occurred, and was most noticeable in the Cedar Rapids metro where photos showed accumulation on power lines.||Snow was widespread across the area during the morning of January 31, 2021, and all of eastern Iowa, northwest Illinois and far northeast Missouri saw some form of accumulating snow. Totals were highest in parts of east central Iowa and in north central Illinois, where locally heavy banding at times on the morning of January 31 produced higher snowfall rates.

The snow came down heavily for a couple hours on the evening of the 8th, when visibility was reduced to one-quarter mile. Temperatures were mostly in the 20's, which allowed the snow to stick on roads and impact travel.

A renewed shot of Arctic air surged into the area over the weekend, and temperatures struggled to make it out of the single digits Sunday and Monday, with lows dropping below zero. Deep atmospheric lift provided by coupled upper-level jet streaks, an approaching mid-level trough, and mid-level frontogenesis took advantage of modest Gulf moisture moving north into the mid-Mississippi Valley to produce snow, heavy at times, Monday the 15th of February. The highest snowfall amounts occurred in east-central and southeast Missouri and southern Illinois where stout lift and the highest moisture resided.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A strong storm system in the upper levels of the atmosphere moved east-northeast across the lower and mid Mississippi Valley on President's Day. A round of light snow the night before President's Day produced an inch or two in many locations. The primary period of heavy snow was on President's Day, when snowfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour. Visibility was one-quarter mile or less in the heavy snow. Snowfall totals for the winter storm varied greatly. Sleet brought snowfall totals downward across areas along the Ohio River. Due to extensive blowing and drifting, accurate snowfall amounts were difficult to obtain. The highest average amounts were around 9 inches from the Shawnee hills north and west, including the Carbondale and Marion areas. The lowest amounts were along the Ohio River, where around 5 to 7 inches fell on average. In some cases, narrow bands of heavy snow resulted in sharp differences in storm-total snowfall across a small area.  Impacts were rather high. Most schools and businesses were shut down either due to the storm or the federal holiday. Wind chills were dangerously cold, at times ranging from minus 10 to minus 15. Sub-zero wind chills were observed as far south as Tennessee. Observers reported drifts as high as three to four feet in the open farm country of southern Illinois, making roads impassable to smaller lightweight vehicles. The very cold temperatures hampered removal of the snow.",

An anomalously cold Arctic air mass had engulfed the region for a week prior to this event, keeping temperatures below freezing. A renewed shot of Arctic air surged into the area over the weekend, and temperatures struggled to make it out of the single digits Sunday and Monday, with lows dropping below zero. Deep atmospheric lift provided by coupled upper-level jet streaks, an approaching mid-level trough, and mid-level frontogenesis took advantage of modest Gulf moisture moving north into the mid-Mississippi Valley to produce snow, heavy at times, Monday the 15th of February. The highest snowfall amounts occurred in east-central and southeast Missouri and southern Illinois where stout lift and the highest moisture resided.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A strong winter storm moved across northern Illinois on February 15th and 16th, producing a widespread area of 4 to 8 inches of snow.  Lake enhanced snow combined to produce a narrow axis of 12 to 18 inches across extreme eastern Lake County, much of Cook County and eastern Will County.  This snow, combined with previous multiple snowfalls, caused multiple roof collapses, many to barns and vacant or compromised structures.  Two people were injured when the awning on the back of a building collapsed in the south side of Chicago.  One of the two injured, a man later died from his injuries.||Some of the highest snow totals in the lake enhanced snow axis included 18.6 inches in Chicago, West Ridge; 18.2 inches one mile north northeast of Oak Park; 18.0 inches in Evanston; 17.7 inches one mile east northeast of Bridgeview; 17.7 inches three miles southwest of Midway Airport; 17.0 inches in Chicago, Lincoln Square; 16.0 inches two miles west northwest of Wilmette; 16.0 inches in Chicago, Albany Park; 15.6 inches in Highwood; 15.0 inches in Harwood Heights; 14.5 inches in Thorton and in Oak Lawn; 13.0 inches in Chicago, Beverly and in Chicago Ridge; 11.0 inches three miles east northeast of Crete and 9.7 inches in Northbrook.  Chicago O'Hare Airport measured 7.5 inches.||Additional snowfall amounts included 9.0 inches in Chatsworth; 8.2 inches in Lombard; 8.0 inches in Dwight; 7.8 inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville; 7.4 inches in Peotone; 7.3 inches in St. Anne; 6.5 inches in Paxton; 5.9 inches in Ottawa; 5.5 inches three miles northwest of Carbon Hill; 5.3 inches in St. Charles; 5.0 inches in Naperville; 4.9 inches six miles east of Ashkum; 4.8 inches one mile west southwest of Streator and 4.5 inches one mile southeast of Mendota.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "In the wake of the departing Presidents Day winter storm, Arctic air surged south on gusty north winds. Dangerously low wind chills were observed during the early and mid morning hours. Gusty north winds were accompanied by actual temperatures around zero degrees, including a low of 2 below zero at Carbondale. Wind chills dropped as low as minus 10 to minus 15 degrees over much of southern Illinois. This Arctic outbreak was part of a longer duration cold snap that descended into the region on February 7 and didn't let up until the afternoon on February 20. The duration of this cold air outbreak was impressive for the lower Ohio Valley. Carbondale, IL tied an all-time record with 13 consecutive days remaining below 32 degrees (set in 1978). Aided by a fresh deep snowpack, overnight lows plummeted below zero in many locations on the mornings of February 16 and 19. Another impressive feat was the duration of dangerously cold wind chills observed February 14-16. In Carbondale, a record-shattering 86 consecutive hours with wind chills below 0 were recorded. The previous record was 22 hours on New Years Day 2018. Wind chill data goes back to 1973 in Carbondale. Carbondale observed an average temperature of 8.0 degrees over a 5-day period from February 13-17. This was the coldest 5 day period since the mid 1990's.

Dangerously low wind chills were observed during the early and mid morning hours. Gusty north winds were accompanied by actual temperatures around zero degrees, including a low of 2 below zero at Carbondale. Wind chills dropped as low as minus 10 to minus 15 degrees over much of southern Illinois. This Arctic outbreak was part of a longer duration cold snap that descended into the region on February 7 and didn't let up until the afternoon on February 20. The duration of this cold air outbreak was impressive for the lower Ohio Valley. Carbondale, IL tied an all-time record with 13 consecutive days remaining below 32 degrees (set in 1978). Aided by a fresh deep snowpack, overnight lows plummeted below zero in many locations on the mornings of February 16 and 19. Another impressive feat was the duration of dangerously cold wind chills observed February 14-16. In Carbondale, a record-shattering 86 consecutive hours with wind chills below 0 were recorded. The previous record was 22 hours on New Years Day 2018. Wind chill data goes back to 1973 in Carbondale.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "In the wake of the departing Presidents Day winter storm, Arctic air surged south on gusty north winds. Dangerously low wind chills were observed during the early and mid morning hours. Gusty north winds were accompanied by actual temperatures around zero degrees, including a low of 2 below zero at Carbondale. Wind chills dropped as low as minus 10 to minus 15 degrees over much of southern Illinois. This Arctic outbreak was part of a longer duration cold snap that descended into the region on February 7 and didn't let up until the afternoon on February 20. The duration of this cold air outbreak was impressive for the lower Ohio Valley. Carbondale, IL tied an all-time record with 13 consecutive days remaining below 32 degrees (set in 1978). Aided by a fresh deep snowpack, overnight lows plummeted below zero in many locations on the mornings of February 16 and 19. Another impressive feat was the duration of dangerously cold wind chills observed February 14-16. In Carbondale, a record-shattering 86 consecutive hours with wind chills below 0 were recorded. The previous record was 22 hours on New Years Day 2018. Wind chill data goes back to 1973 in Carbondale. Carbondale observed an average temperature of 8.0 degrees over a 5-day period from February 13-17. This was the coldest 5 day period since the mid 1990's. Carbondale had four record cold high temperatures and three record low temperatures during the February 13-17 period.",

The previous record was 22 hours on New Years Day 2018. Wind chill data goes back to 1973 in Carbondale. Carbondale observed an average temperature of 8.0 degrees over a 5-day period from February 13-17. This was the coldest 5 day period since the mid 1990's. Carbondale had four record cold high temperatures and three record low temperatures during the February 13-17 period.",

The tornado first touched down north of Saint Jacob, IL along Marine Road where it toppled several trees and partially tore the roof off a large metal shed. The tornado then likely lifted briefly, but then touched down again intermittently along Lake Road. The tornado did minor roof and siding damage to many homes along Lake Road, as well as topple several trees and snapped a power line. The worst of the damage, which was rated EF-1, was to a large metal shed that was destroyed and the roof was lofted into nearby trees and pushed hundreds of feet down the street. In addition, a 2x4 from this roof was driven straight into the roof of a nearby building. The tornado then likely lifted briefly, before touching down again and doing additional damage to large trees in a neighborhood along 15th and 16th Streets. The tornado then lifted and dissipated. Overall the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 5.29 miles and a max path width of 700 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported.",

Steep mid-level lapse rates existed atop these steep low-level lapse rates, resulting in at least 7.0 degree C/km lapse rates from the surface to above 500 mb. A few storms in this environment produced large hail. Additionally, increased surface vorticity existed in the immediate vicinity of the frontal boundary. The  combination of the steep lapse rates and surface vorticity resulted in a unique environment for brief landspouts. One such landspout occurred in the Interstate 64 corridor.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "A tornado with peak winds of 140 mph touched down just south of 75th Street, west of Book Road in the western portion of the Springbrook Prairie Forest Preserve.  The near continuous damage path started near Plainfield-Naperville Road and Sheppey Court where considerable tree damage occurred.  Significant tree damage began just east of Modaff Road with trees snapped and others uprooted along Quall Drive.  Significant tree damage occurred near Verdin Lane with trees uprooted, trunks snapped and large tree limbs broken and tossed into homes.  Damage to homes in this area appeared to be primarily due to falling trees.  Tree damage continued through Killdeer Drive and along Bailey Road.  Damage to roofs occurred to some homes in this area.  Several utility poles were blown down on Bailey Road, between Lighthouse Drive and Coach Drive.  Windows were broken and debris was embedded in stucco on a southside wall of an apartment building on the southeast corner of Bailey Road and Coach Drive.  The tornado gradually intensified east of Naper Boulevard.  Large trees were snapped just east of Naper Boulevard along Bailey Road.  One fell onto a home causing roof damage.  Naperville Fire Station #2 was damaged.||The tornado jogged to the northeast and began to increase in width with tree damage continuing through Fender Road, where roof and wall damage occurred to a home from a falling tree.  Tree damage continued through Clemson Drive and Wehrli Road.  Widespread tree damage occurred near 77th Street where one car was flipped over and a second car was damaged by debris.  Roof and siding damage occurred to homes and a garage wall was removed.  A garage door was blown in and a wall was destroyed on Siebert Court.  The tornado destroyed a home on Princeton Circle.  The house completely collapsed with debris deposited to the northeast, though homes on either side remained standing with only minor damage.  It is at this location that the tornado reached peak intensity of EF3.  In the same block, considerable damage occurred to roofs of several nearby homes.  Damage to homes continued along Nutmeg Lane to Shady Grove Court, including the removal of walls on the second floor of at least one home and roofing damage to several others.  The tornado increased in width as it moved between 75th and 79th Streets, destroying garages and lifting roofing of an apartment complex along Gladstone Drive.  Considerable tree damage also occurred in the Green Valley Forest Preserve as the tornado crossed Greene Road.||The tornado continued east across Route 53 with tree and roof damage noted.  More significant damage began again near Woodridge Drive.  Several homes were damaged with large trees uprooted or snapped.  Multiple fences were also blown down.  Damage to homes continued near Evergreen Lane and James Court where several homes suffered significant roof and second story damage.  The tornado crossed Interstate 355 where a large portion of a traffic sign on southbound Interstate 355 was ripped off two steel posts.  The missing section of the traffic sign was found in a pond in the Lake Ridge Club, between 79th Street and 81st Street, east of Madison Street in Burr Ridge, nearly 6 miles from its original location.||Significant damage occurred to homes and apartment buildings east of Interstate 355 between Country Club Drive and Egerton Drive.  Some roofs were completely removed.  Tree and roof damage continued along Pine Drive and Britten Street.  The tornado began to increase in width again as it crossed Lemont Road where a warehouse building was damaged.  Tree and roof damage continued through Highland Avenue, Plainfield Road, Bailey Road and Cass Avenue.  At least one apartment building suffered significant roof damage along Lakeview Drive.  East of Cass Avenue, the tornado produced mainly tree damage, crossing Interstate 55, then Route 83 and then moving east along 83rd Street.  Damage occurred to several dozen homes in Burr Ridge.  The tornado crossed into Cook County near 83rd Street.||In Naperville, 231 structures reported some level of damage.  One home was completely destroyed, 19 were declared uninhabitable and 143 sustained major damage.  In Woodridge, 640 structures were damaged, including 31 homes that were uninhabitable and 157 that sustained major damage.  In Darrien, 2 homes were damaged and 1 was uninhabitable.  In Burr Ridge, 50 homes were damaged.  A total of 11 people were injured, including a woman who was 6 months pregnant and was critically injured.  She lost her unborn baby as the result of her injuries.",

Locations from Funks Grove through Shirley to southern and eastern parts of Bloomington experienced a 500-year rainfall (0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year).  Due to the tremendous amount of rainfall, significant flash flooding occurred across central and southern McLean County into far northern Logan County, including the city of Bloomington.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water, several water rescues needed to be performed due to stranded motorists, part of the I-55 shoulder collapsed near Kickapoo Creek, and Kickapoo Creek reached record levels and flooded several homes in Lawndale in far northern Logan County.",

The first wave of heavy rain began around 7pm CDT June 25th and persisted until around 11pm that evening before tapering off.  Rainfall amounts across southern McLean County ranged from 4 to 7 inches in 4 hours, with the heaviest rain extending from near the town of McLean through Bloomington-Normal southeastward toward LeRoy.  The second wave of heavy rain occurred during the afternoon of June 26th when additional amounts of 2 to 4 inches fell across the same areas of southern McLean County that had been impacted the previous evening.  Storm total rainfall between 6pm CDT June 25th and 6pm CDT June 26th ranged from 6 to 11 inches across southern McLean County, with a maximum amount of 10.71 inches measured 1.5 miles east-southeast of Bloomington...which represented a 1,000-year rainfall (0.1 percent chance of occurring in any given year).  Locations from Funks Grove through Shirley to southern and eastern parts of Bloomington experienced a 500-year rainfall (0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year).  Due to the tremendous amount of rainfall, significant flash flooding occurred across central and southern McLean County into far northern Logan County, including the city of Bloomington.

Along North 2350th Road near Armstrong Run, flood waters flowed over the roadway with debris in the channel.  North La Salle Road was flooded, just south of Dupont Road with debris piled on the side of the road along with erosion in the channel.  There was substantial deposition of sediment from a nearby sand and gravel facility across Dupont Road near Deadly Run.  A substantial stretch of Dupont Road was flooded with extensive mud marking on pavement, east of Route 170 near a marina.  Just west of Route 170, the east abutment to the River Road bridge over a small creek was washed out.  A local highway department staff member was driving over this area when the washout occurred.  His truck became stuck on remaining pavement on either side of the washout.  The driver needed to be rescued and refused medical treatment.  Scouring occurred on both sides of the creek with vegetation collapsed or partially collapsed.  Homes on Timmons Lane were flooded with one home suffering a basement wall collapse.  Further west near River Road and Lake Street, flooding of several houses occurred as Spring Brook Creek overflowed with water flowing over fields and into the houses.  Significant damage occurred to vegetation where Spring Brook Creek crossed River Road.  Rainfall of 4.24 inches was reported during a 3 hour period, one mile east of Seneca.

Thanks to copious atmospheric moisture and the slow-movement of the storms, very heavy rainfall of 6 to 8 inches was observed across northwestern McLean County...including 8.25 in the town of Danvers.  As a result, significant flash flooding occurred from Danvers to Carlock just northwest of Bloomington-Normal.  In addition, a Mesoscale Convective Vortex (MCV) generated by convection earlier in the day across the Plains tracked into west-central Illinois, triggering scattered severe thunderstorms along and west of the Illinois River.  Isolated wind damage occurred with these cells.",

As the storms approached the Mississippi River, a large swath of strong winds developed behind the storms, resulting in sustained winds of 40 to 60 mph, and damage through the Quad Cities metro area. This type of event is due to a wake low pressure system, behind the storms.

As the storms approached the Mississippi River, a large swath of strong winds developed behind the storms, resulting in sustained winds of 40 to 60 mph, and damage through the Quad Cities metro area. This type of event is due to a wake low pressure system, behind the storms.  A significant thunderstorm wind event did take place in Bureau county Illinois eastward, where widespread tree and crop damage took place.",

As the storms approached the Mississippi River, a large swath of strong winds developed behind the storms, resulting in sustained winds of 40 to 60 mph, and damage through the Quad Cities metro area. This type of event is due to a wake low pressure system, behind the storms.

A senior citizen center was inundated with flood waters and multiple water rescues were performed to remove the residents.  To the southwest of Gibson City, vegetation was flattened in many low lying areas due to the fast flowing flood waters.  Rainfall amounts in Gibson City and far southwest Ford County were in the 7 to 9 inch range from late morning through early afternoon.  Measured rainfall amounts included 9.33 inches one mile northeast of Gibson City; 8.76 inches in Gibson City and 7.63 inches three miles west northwest of Gibson City.  During the NWS storm survey, it was discovered that several private rain gauges in Gibson City ranged between 10 to 13 inches.

The tornado moved north-northeast and intensified as it moved into the west side of the town of Wrights, IL. In Wrights, the tornado destroyed two new, well-built farm buildings, ripping one of from a concrete foundation around the perimeter of the building. The tornado then moved to the northeast, destroying two more farm buildings before crossing Wrights road, where it snapped a number of trees and rolled a camper onto a boat. The tornado continued to the northeast causing intermittent damage to trees and vegetation. The high resolution satellite data showed a prominent track in the open fields northeast of the NE 850 Ave and Super Slab Road Intersection. The last identifiable damage and where the tornado appeared to have ended is around a third of a mile west of the NE 1000 Street and NE 950 Ave Intersection. The tornado was rated EF2 with max wind speed of 115 mph. The path length was 5.83 miles with a max path width of 75 yards. No deaths or injuries were reported.",

Despite limited instability (energy for storms to develop), plentiful shear (changing wind speed or direction with height) from a potent mid-level storm system provided the potential for severe storms. Though most storms never became strong or severe, one supercell in particular became organized enough to produce a tornado.",

They quickly intensified, remaining somewhat isolated as they moved through southeast Missouri and into southwest Illinois. The environment was very favorable for tornadic development, and these storms produced several tornadoes and wind damage as they moved through the area. Two storms produced tornadoes that remained on the ground for significant distances. The  tornado that moved through Fredericktown, MO, passing through Madison County into Perry County, was on the ground for 18.9 miles. Another tornado moved from St. Francois County through St. Genevieve County in Missouri into Randolph County in Illinois, staying on the ground for over 40 miles.",

As the storms moved northeastward, they moved into a moist, energy-rich environment with substantial wind shear in the low and mid-levels. They quickly intensified, remaining somewhat isolated as they moved through southeast Missouri and into southwest Illinois. The environment was very favorable for tornadic development, and these storms produced several tornadoes and wind damage as they moved through the area. Two storms produced tornadoes that remained on the ground for significant distances. The  tornado that moved through Fredericktown, MO, passing through Madison County into Perry County, was on the ground for 18.9 miles. Another tornado moved from St. Francois County through St. Genevieve County in Missouri into Randolph County in Illinois, staying on the ground for over 40 miles.",

Genevieve County) into Illinois (Randolph County) moving though flood plains and crossing the Mississippi River just north of the Menard Correctional Center.  The tornado crossed Route 3 south of Lochhead Drive destroying a small barn, snapping or uprooting trees, and caused minor damage to several homes and a hardware store. Snapped or uprooted trees and downed power poles were found along the remainder of the tornado track through Chester with roof damage to several homes on Brenda Street. The worst damage in Chester occurred just northeast of the Palestine Road and Three Spring Roads intersection, where two farm outbuildings were completely destroyed. The larger of the two buildings was well-built with anchor bolts every 18-24 inches in the concrete foundation. This damage was rated EF-2. Further northeast, minor roof damage and the loss of the roof-mounted HVAC unit was found at the nursing home near Old Lodge Lane and Three Springs Road. The tornado continued to the northeast into Bremen paralleling and crossing Route 150, producing tree damage and minor roof damage to several homes. Minor roof damage to several homes, damage to several farm outbuildings, and snapped and uprooted trees were found along parts of Chester Road and Paradise Road. The worst of this damage was rated EF-1. The tornado dissipated around 1.6 miles northeast of Bremen, just west of Route 150. Overall the tornado was rated EF2 with a path length of 16.47 miles and a max path width of 400 yards.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Numerous severe thunderstorms formed ahead of an approaching cold front across southeast Missouri during the evening hours of Sunday, October 24th, 2021. As the storms moved northeastward, they moved into a moist, energy-rich environment with substantial wind shear in the low and mid-levels. They quickly intensified, remaining somewhat isolated as they moved through southeast Missouri and into southwest Illinois. The environment was very favorable for tornadic development, and these storms produced several tornadoes and wind damage as they moved through the area. Two storms produced tornadoes that remained on the ground for significant distances. The  tornado that moved through Fredericktown, MO, passing through Madison County into Perry County, was on the ground for 18.9 miles. Another tornado moved from St. Francois County through St. Genevieve County in Missouri into Randolph County in Illinois, staying on the ground for over 40 miles.",

The environment was very favorable for tornadic development, and these storms produced several tornadoes and wind damage as they moved through the area. Two storms produced tornadoes that remained on the ground for significant distances. The  tornado that moved through Fredericktown, MO, passing through Madison County into Perry County, was on the ground for 18.9 miles. Another tornado moved from St. Francois County through St. Genevieve County in Missouri into Randolph County in Illinois, staying on the ground for over 40 miles.",

The tornado tracked northeastward, significantly damaging a pair of metal sheds along Pin Hook Avenue.  It mainly passed through open fields until reaching a farm along Masters Avenue about a half mile west of Fairgrounds Street where a machine shed was destroyed and a couple other outbuildings were damaged.  The worst damage was along Altig Bridge Avenue about a half mile east of Fairgrounds Street.  A house sustained significant damage to its roof, several trees were snapped, and sheds across the road were damaged or destroyed.  From this point, the tornado mainly traveled in farm fields, overturning an irrigation pivot before lifting just shy of the Sangamon River at 8:16 PM CST.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A deepening area of low pressure tracked from near Kansas City during the afternoon of December 10th to southern Lake Michigan by the pre-dawn hours of December 11th.  An unseasonably warm and moist airmass surged northward ahead of the system, resulting in high temperatures reaching the lower to middle 60s across central Illinois.  As the low and an associated vigorous short-wave trough interacted with the moderately unstable and highly sheared environment, several clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms developed during the late afternoon and evening of the 10th.  Numerous rotating cells were observed, with a total of 6 tornadoes touching down across central Illinois.  5 of the tornadoes were rated EF-2, including one that injured a person just north of Herrick in Shelby County.",

Unfortunately two of the tornadoes were very strong (rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) and responsible for 7 fatalities (one near Defiance, Missouri and six at an Amazon Facility near Edwardsville, Illinois). The Defiance, MO tornado tracked within one mile of the NWS St. Louis office in the Missouri Research Park near Weldon Spring, MO leading to the staff sheltering while NWS Kansas City provided service backup.  This is only the third time in the office's existence that the staff had to shelter. The damage from the Defiance, MO EF3 tornado was estimated at $684,186 and is unknown for the remaining tracks at this time but early estimates are well into the millions due to the damage sustained at the Amazon facility near Edwardsville, IL.",

The west-facing walls of the warehouse collapsed inward, which was followed by multiple structural failures as the tornado moved through the complex, including the collapse of additional walls and the loss of a large segment of the roof. This was the worst damage along the entire tornado track rated EF-3. Cars in the rear of the building were strewn eastward and power lines and several large high tension towers were also destroyed. There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST. Noteworthy is debris from the Amazon warehouse was found along the entire track of this storm, tens of miles to the northeast of the warehouse. Overall, the tornado was rated EF3 with a path length of 4.22 miles and max path width of 300 yards. Six deaths and one injured were reported.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Numerous severe thunderstorms formed ahead of an approaching cold front during the late afternoon and evening of Friday December 10th, 2021.  Large hail, damaging winds and five tornadoes occurred across central and eastern Missouri as well as south central Illinois.  Unfortunately two of the tornadoes were very strong (rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) and responsible for 7 fatalities (one near Defiance, Missouri and six at an Amazon Facility near Edwardsville, Illinois). The Defiance, MO tornado tracked within one mile of the NWS St. Louis office in the Missouri Research Park near Weldon Spring, MO leading to the staff sheltering while NWS Kansas City provided service backup.  This is only the third time in the office's existence that the staff had to shelter. The damage from the Defiance, MO EF3 tornado was estimated at $684,186 and is unknown for the remaining tracks at this time but early estimates are well into the millions due to the damage sustained at the Amazon facility near Edwardsville, IL.",
