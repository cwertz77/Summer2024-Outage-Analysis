Ground surfaces were relatively warm following three days of high temperatures in the 50's and 60's. Therefore, impacts on travel were quite minor due to the melting on pavement. The area with the worst icing was along the Route 13 corridor from Carbondale and Murphysboro eastward across Harrisburg. Along this corridor, around one-quarter inch of ice on trees and power lines resulted in isolated power outages and downed tree limbs. About 500 utility customers were without power across portions of the Marion-Carbondale area. The freezing rain occurred north of a stationary front that extended from southern Arkansas to southern Tennessee. High pressure over the Upper Mississippi Valley produced a cold northeast wind flow at the surface.",

Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

The first was where a minivan was thrown about 30 yards and a home was lifted off its foundation and left with only its interior walls intact. The second was at the Pilkington Glass plant where one section of the factory was completely destroyed. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River and moved through the south side of Ottawa, producing an 800 yard wide path of EF1 damage to trees and homes. The fatalities in Ottawa occurred from a tree falling onto two men who were working outside.

Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

The tornado broke windows and did roof damage to a house and destroyed several outbuildings about a mile from its origin.  The tornado rapidly widened to more than 1/4 mile across and increased in intensity to EF-3 as it destroyed a house about 2.5 miles west of Washburn.  One mile to the east, the tornado tore the roof off a house before moving into Washburn.  The tornado damaged 8 houses in town...doing significant damage to roofs, garages, automobiles, and trees before crossing into extreme southern Marshall County at 5:31 PM CST.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An unseasonably warm and humid airmass was in place across central Illinois on February 28th...with afternoon high temperatures soaring to record levels in the upper 60s and lower 70s.  Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "This large tornado entered Jackson County from Randolph County near the community of Rockwood. The tornado originally began near Perryville, Missouri, where it achieved its peak intensity in the EF-4 category. The tornado crossed the entire width of Jackson County, entering the county about two miles from the Mississippi River. The tornado passed just south of Ava, clipped the southern edge of Vergennes, and then passed near the north edge of Elkville before exiting the northeast corner of the county. In Jackson County, the tornado reached a maximum intensity of EF-3 on the south end of Vergennes. Winds estimated near 145 mph destroyed a house. The wood house was not securely anchored to the foundation, and other construction details suggested wind speeds were below the EF-4 category. Elsewhere in Jackson County, the tornado passed through mainly rural farmlands and woods. Thousands of large trees were snapped and uprooted, and dozens of homes and other structures were damaged or destroyed. The tornado remained quite wide, nearly one-third of a mile at times. The average path width in Jackson County was about 600 yards. The tornado continued east-northeast into Franklin County.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Isolated supercell thunderstorms moved into southern Illinois during the evening hours. The storms developed ahead of a cold front in a destabilizing air mass characterized by dew points in the lower to mid 60's. The most intense supercell storm awaited the approach of a mid-level impulse from Oklahoma, which was downstream from the primary shortwave trough over the southern Plains. The supercell produced two long-track strong tornadoes, the first of which originated in Perry County, Missouri and tracked almost 50 miles before dissipating. The second strong tornado formed in the Wabash Valley and crossed into southwest Indiana. A southwesterly low-level jet increased substantially during the evening, creating favorable conditions for tornadoes.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "This large tornado entered Franklin County from Jackson County. The tornado originally formed near Perryville, Missouri. The most intense damage in Franklin County was located south of Mulkeytown, where the tornado was rated EF-3 based on a house that was swept clean off its foundation. Debris was thrown up to a mile downwind. The debris was shredded, with nothing larger than 2-by-4 wood pieces. However, the house was sitting on a block foundation, unattached to anything. Based on the lack of any anchors for the house, peak winds were estimated near 160 mph at this site. Most of the other damage in this rural area of Franklin County consisted of snapped trees, heavily damaged barns, and a few damaged houses. The tornado rapidly weakened from EF-3 intensity to complete dissipation during the final two miles of its path. The average path width in Franklin County was 340 yards. The total path length starting near Perryville, Missouri was nearly 50 miles. The tornado dissipated just southwest of Christopher.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Isolated supercell thunderstorms moved into southern Illinois during the evening hours. The storms developed ahead of a cold front in a destabilizing air mass characterized by dew points in the lower to mid 60's. The most intense supercell storm awaited the approach of a mid-level impulse from Oklahoma, which was downstream from the primary shortwave trough over the southern Plains. The supercell produced two long-track strong tornadoes, the first of which originated in Perry County, Missouri and tracked almost 50 miles before dissipating. The second strong tornado formed in the Wabash Valley and crossed into southwest Indiana. A southwesterly low-level jet increased substantially during the evening, creating favorable conditions for tornadoes.",

The supercell produced two long-track strong tornadoes, the first of which originated in Perry County, Missouri and tracked almost 50 miles before dissipating. The second strong tornado formed in the Wabash Valley and crossed into southwest Indiana.

Thanks to these extremely warm temperatures and dewpoints surging into the upper 50s and lower 60s, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values exceeded 1500J/kg across Missouri and the western half of Illinois by late afternoon.  In addition, a strong mid-level jet streak enhanced 0-6km wind shear to an impressive 60-70kt.  While the airmass within the warm sector was initially capped, an approaching upper wave helped weaken the cap and set the stage for strong to severe thunderstorms into the evening.  As a cold front pushed across the Mississippi River, supercell thunderstorms initiated across west-central Illinois during the late afternoon and lingered into the evening.  These storms produced a total of 4 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), including an EF-3 tornado that touched down west of Washburn in Woodford County.  Other storms produced scattered reports of large hail and damaging winds across the area.",

Just west of Highway 1, several vehicles were rolled over and moved, and a single-wide mobile home was destroyed. Near where the tornado crossed Route 1, an older house was moved three feet off its foundation. The house did not appear to be bolted to the foundation. Most of the second floor was removed. A double-wide mobile home was destroyed in the same area near Route 1. The width of the damage path was about 300 yards along Route 1. Just south of Crossville on County Road 1675E, a vehicle was rolled about 30 yards, and a house was destroyed. Some walls of the house collapsed, and most of the roof came off. Peak winds at this location were estimated near 150 mph. The sole fatality occurred south of Crossville, where an elderly man was caught outdoors when the tornado struck. The man was found in a farm field about 40 yards from his house. His wife was inside in the house, and she received scrapes and bruises. Another EF-3 damage location was east of Crossville, where a vehicle was moved about 30 yards and an old house was partially destroyed. The average path width was about 300 yards in White County.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Significant flooding developed after two thunderstorm complexes crossed southern Illinois, bringing 72-hour rainfall totals to nearly one foot in isolated locations. A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southern Illinois during the evening hours of the 29th. These storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Illinois during the evening. During the overnight hours through the early morning of the 30th, an even larger complex of thunderstorms dumped widespread very heavy rain. This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 11.27 inches at a television station in Carterville (Williamson County).

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Significant flooding developed after two thunderstorm complexes crossed southern Illinois, bringing 72-hour rainfall totals to nearly one foot in isolated locations. A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southern Illinois during the evening hours of the 29th. These storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Illinois during the evening. During the overnight hours through the early morning of the 30th, an even larger complex of thunderstorms dumped widespread very heavy rain. This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 11.27 inches at a television station in Carterville (Williamson County). A co-operative observer at Carbondale measured 10.37 inches over the three-day period. In West Frankfort (Franklin County), a Cocorahs observer measured 10.16 inches. North of the Ohio River counties, there were numerous reports of rainfall in the 5 to 10 inch range, including 9.75 inches at Ridgway (Gallatin County), 9.34 inches at Marion, 8.75 inches at West Frankfort (Franklin County), and 8.75 inches at Du Quoin (Perry County). Lesser amounts were reported in far southern counties bordering the Ohio River.",

Areas along the Meramec River were especially hard hit as new records were set at Steelville, Sullivan, and Eureka. The previous records had just recently been set during the late December flooding of 2015. Two major highways, I-44 and I-55 were shut down for a number of days due to the record river flooding from this event. A few thunderstorms also became severe during the afternoon of April 29th, with two weak tornadoes documented.",

Rainfall totals surpassed nine inches in some locations and this led to flash flooding and historic flooding along some of the tributaries of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Areas along the Meramec River were especially hard hit as new records were set at Steelville, Sullivan, and Eureka. The previous records had just recently been set during the late December flooding of 2015. Two major highways, I-44 and I-55 were shut down for a number of days due to the record river flooding from this event. A few thunderstorms also became severe during the afternoon of April 29th, with two weak tornadoes documented.",

Areas along the Meramec River were especially hard hit as new records were set at Steelville, Sullivan, and Eureka. The previous records had just recently been set during the late December flooding of 2015. Two major highways, I-44 and I-55 were shut down for a number of days due to the record river flooding from this event.

Areas along the Meramec River were especially hard hit as new records were set at Steelville, Sullivan, and Eureka. The previous records had just recently been set during the late December flooding of 2015. Two major highways, I-44 and I-55 were shut down for a number of days due to the record river flooding from this event.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Significant flooding developed after two thunderstorm complexes crossed southern Illinois, bringing 72-hour rainfall totals to nearly one foot in isolated locations. A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southern Illinois during the evening hours of the 29th. These storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Illinois during the evening. During the overnight hours through the early morning of the 30th, an even larger complex of thunderstorms dumped widespread very heavy rain. This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 11.27 inches at a television station in Carterville (Williamson County). A co-operative observer at Carbondale measured 10.37 inches over the three-day period. In West Frankfort (Franklin County), a Cocorahs observer measured 10.16 inches. North of the Ohio River counties, there were numerous reports of rainfall in the 5 to 10 inch range, including 9.75 inches at Ridgway (Gallatin County), 9.34 inches at Marion, 8.75 inches at West Frankfort (Franklin County), and 8.75 inches at Du Quoin (Perry County). Lesser amounts were reported in far southern counties bordering the Ohio River.",

The rain developed as numerous weak impulses interacted with a stationary frontal boundary draped along I-70.  Thunderstorms with very high rainfall rates dropped 2 to 3 inches of rain across much of the area, with a few locations across portions of Marshall and Woodford counties picking up in excess of 3.5 inches.  This rainfall occurring on top of already saturated soils, created flash flooding in a number of locations.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water...including portions of Highway 29 in Peoria where a mudslide occurred, Illinois Route 17 from Lacon to Sparland in Marshall County, Illinois Route 97 from Lincoln's New Salem to Petersburg in Menard County, Route 45 near Tuscola in Douglas County, Route 9 west of Canton in Fulton County, and portions of Route 26 in Woodford County.   Low pressure lifted into the Great Lakes on May 1st, pulling the persistent frontal boundary out of the area and bringing a temporary end to the rain.  Even though the rain had stopped, high water continued to impact many rural roads across central Illinois, particularly those near creeks and streams.  Persistent flooding issues occurred across Christian, Shelby, Douglas, and Effingham counties...as well as along the Embarras River in Cumberland and Jasper counties.",

Blowing dust cut the visibility to near zero in some locations, prompting closures of several major roadways.  Portions of I-72 on the south side of Springfield, as well as near New Berlin were closed for a time.  I-55 near McLean and IL-104 between I-55 and Auburn were temporarily closed as well.  Numerous traffic accidents occurred due to the blowing dust, including two that resulted in fatalities.  One person died in an accident on I-72 near New Berlin, and another person was killed in a 6-car accident on Route 36 near Tuscola.",

Illinois Route 1 was impassable from near the Iroquois County line to 3 miles southwest of Hoopeston. The combination of additional rainfall during the late evening hours and slowly melting hail drifts kept flash flood conditions in place until the early morning hours of May 27th.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Supercell thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of a warm front draped along the I-74 corridor during the afternoon and early evening of May 26th.  The hardest hit area was northern Vermilion County...where powerful cells produced a tornado, damaging winds, and extremely large hail.  An EF-1 tornado touched down northwest of Alvin, damaging trees, the roof and siding of a house, and a garage.  Meanwhile, 80-90mph winds produced nearly $3 million worth of tree and property damage in Rossville.  Very large hail up to the size of tennis balls were reported in Rankin.  In addition, extreme rainfall rates caused flash flooding in Hoopeston.",

Large tree limbs were down in the yard of a residence in Vienna, and four medium to large trees were down at a neighboring residence. Ten to fifteen shingles were blown off a house at Vienna. A few miles west of Vienna, trees were blown over a roadway. Other tree damage occurred between Vienna and Cypress. Within one-half mile of the Massac County line on U.S. Highway 45, large tree limbs were broken, and about a dozen shingles were blown off of a roof.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An organized severe weather outbreak affected southern Illinois with numerous damaging wind gusts and isolated large hail. Most of the damaging winds were south of the Marion-Carbondale area. The storms formed along and south of a stalled front that was over southern Illinois and southern Indiana. By the afternoon hours, large amounts of moisture and instability were present, along with plenty of deep-layer wind shear. As a mid-level disturbance lifted out of the Southern Plains, multiple storm clusters and bowing segments formed across Missouri and southern Illinois in a very favorable environment for severe thunderstorms. Dew points were in the lower 70's in many locations in the afternoon, coupled with surface cape values of 3000-4000 j/kg. Boundaries left over from early morning storms also played a role in the placement of afternoon thunderstorm development. Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms impacted the Middle Mississippi Valley on the first day of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. There were two or three bowing lines of thunderstorms that impacted the region with damaging winds. Individual cells and clusters also developed early on in the event, producing mainly large hail. Multiple rounds of storms over the same locations also resulted in a few flooding issues.",

Most of the damaging winds were south of the Marion-Carbondale area. The storms formed along and south of a stalled front that was over southern Illinois and southern Indiana. By the afternoon hours, large amounts of moisture and instability were present, along with plenty of deep-layer wind shear. As a mid-level disturbance lifted out of the Southern Plains, multiple storm clusters and bowing segments formed across Missouri and southern Illinois in a very favorable environment for severe thunderstorms. Dew points were in the lower 70's in many locations in the afternoon, coupled with surface cape values of 3000-4000 j/kg. Boundaries left over from early morning storms also played a role in the placement of afternoon thunderstorm development. Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms impacted the Middle Mississippi Valley on the first day of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. There were two or three bowing lines of thunderstorms that impacted the region with damaging winds. Individual cells and clusters also developed early on in the event, producing mainly large hail. Multiple rounds of storms over the same locations also resulted in a few flooding issues.",

Torrential rainfall of 3 to 4 inches resulted in flash flooding of many county roads from northeast Peoria County and Stark County eastward to northern McLean County.  Water rescues were necessary in the city of Normal due to the excessive rainfall rates.  Other areas that experienced severe weather were from near Beardstown in Cass County eastward to Springfield...and across Effingham and Clay counties.",

The center of the high gradually shifted east from the southern Plains on the 19th to the middle Mississippi Valley on the 22nd. The high then weakened and shrank on the 23rd. The daily peak heat indices at Carbondale during the heat wave were 108 degrees on the 19th and 20th, 111 degrees on the 21st, and 106 degrees on the 22nd. Actual air temperatures reached the mid 90's each afternoon. Overnight lows were in the mid 70's.",

Within the overall area of scattered damage, more concentrated damage was located in Bellmont. Hundreds of tree limbs and about a half-dozen trees were blown down. Downed trees and limbs damaged a couple of homes, barns, and garages. Several power poles were blown over. The only damage in Mt. Carmel itself consisted of a few large limbs down on the western edge of the city. Peak winds were estimated near 80 mph.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A fast-moving complex of thunderstorms raced east-southeast from east central Missouri into southern Illinois. Clusters of thunderstorms organized into a squall line over southern Illinois, producing increasingly organized swaths of wind damage. The environment over southern Illinois was characterized by moderately strong instability, with most-unstable layer cape values from 2000 to 3000 j/kg. A strong 500 mb shortwave moved southeast from the upper Mississippi Valley into the western Great Lakes region, likely helping to initiate the storm complex over Missouri. Once it was initiated, the storm complex accompanied an elevated cold front at 850 mb, which was preceded by a southwest wind flow near 30 knots.",

A large pocket of clear sky during the morning helped warm the lower levels of the atmosphere. Instability became sufficient for storms to fire right along the front, where a rather strong capping inversion was broken. A vigorous upper-level trough moving rapidly eastward across the central Plains provided plenty of large-scale forcing for storm initiation. Very strong wind shear was supportive of isolated tornadoes along the evolving quasi-linear convective system. Scattered damaging wind gusts accompanied the leading edge of the activity.",
