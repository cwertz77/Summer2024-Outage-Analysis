            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An Arctic cold front moved rapidly southeast across the lower Ohio Valley on the evening of the 11th. Rain changed to a brief period of freezing rain, then to sleet during the overnight hours. The sleet changed to snow on the 12th as the Arctic air flooded in. In the Ohio and Wabash River counties, a vigorous disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere prolonged the snow through much of the day on the 12th. Total accumulations of sleet were from one-half to one inch in most areas. Freezing rain produced a thin layer of glaze under the sleet and snow. On top of the sleet, snow accumulated from 2 to 4 inches along and southeast of a line from Mount Carmel to Harrisburg and Vienna. Following the changeover to snow, visibility was reduced to one-quarter mile at times in the Ohio and Wabash Valley counties, where peak snowfall rates were near one-half inch per hour. The lowest snow and sleet accumulations were along and northwest of a line from Mount Vernon to Du Quoin, where accumulations were mainly less than one-half inch. Strong north winds frequently gusted to 35 mph, producing wind chills near zero at times. Very cold temperatures in the wake of the storm reduced the effectiveness of melting agents such as salt. Dangerous travel conditions persisted well after the ending of the precipitation. Some vehicle accidents were reported, mainly where the heaviest snow fell in southeast Illinois.",

On top of the sleet, snow accumulated from 2 to 4 inches along and southeast of a line from Mount Carmel to Harrisburg and Vienna. Following the changeover to snow, visibility was reduced to one-quarter mile at times in the Ohio and Wabash Valley counties, where peak snowfall rates were near one-half inch per hour. The lowest snow and sleet accumulations were along and northwest of a line from Mount Vernon to Du Quoin, where accumulations were mainly less than one-half inch. Strong north winds frequently gusted to 35 mph, producing wind chills near zero at times. Very cold temperatures in the wake of the storm reduced the effectiveness of melting agents such as salt. Dangerous travel conditions persisted well after the ending of the precipitation. Some vehicle accidents were reported, mainly where the heaviest snow fell in southeast Illinois.",

Rain changed to a brief period of freezing rain, then to sleet during the overnight hours. The sleet changed to snow on the 12th as the Arctic air flooded in. In the Ohio and Wabash River counties, a vigorous disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere prolonged the snow through much of the day on the 12th. Total accumulations of sleet were from one-half to one inch in most areas. Freezing rain produced a thin layer of glaze under the sleet and snow. On top of the sleet, snow accumulated from 2 to 4 inches along and southeast of a line from Mount Carmel to Harrisburg and Vienna. Following the changeover to snow, visibility was reduced to one-quarter mile at times in the Ohio and Wabash Valley counties, where peak snowfall rates were near one-half inch per hour. The lowest snow and sleet accumulations were along and northwest of a line from Mount Vernon to Du Quoin, where accumulations were mainly less than one-half inch. Strong north winds frequently gusted to 35 mph, producing wind chills near zero at times. Very cold temperatures in the wake of the storm reduced the effectiveness of melting agents such as salt. Dangerous travel conditions persisted well after the ending of the precipitation. Some vehicle accidents were reported, mainly where the heaviest snow fell in southeast Illinois.",

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Snow developed along an Arctic cold front as it sliced southeast across southern Illinois during the morning hours. As the front slowed down over the Tennessee Valley late in the day, a weak surface low developed on the front. This caused snow to linger across the Ohio River counties through the evening hours. The result was an area of heavy snowfall from Vienna south and east, where 4 to 7 inches was reported. The heaviest reported snowfall was in Massac County near Metropolis, where 7 inches fell. Across the remainder of southern Illinois, including Marion, Carbondale, and Harrisburg, amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches. Visibility was frequently reduced below one mile in the heavy snowfall area. Much of the snow melted on treated road surfaces during the day, but conditions rapidly deteriorated after dark as temperatures dropped through the 20's. Wind chill indices were in the teens during most of the snowstorm. Actual air temperatures fell into the teens as the snow ended. These cold temperatures reduced the effectiveness of road salt, which slowed recovery efforts in the wake of the storm. The new snowfall on top of snow from the January 12th storm raised total snow depths to near 10 inches near the Ohio River.",

As the front slowed down over the Tennessee Valley late in the day, a weak surface low developed on the front. This caused snow to linger across the Ohio River counties through the evening hours. The result was an area of heavy snowfall from Vienna south and east, where 4 to 7 inches was reported. The heaviest reported snowfall was in Massac County near Metropolis, where 7 inches fell. Across the remainder of southern Illinois, including Marion, Carbondale, and Harrisburg, amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches. Visibility was frequently reduced below one mile in the heavy snowfall area. Much of the snow melted on treated road surfaces during the day, but conditions rapidly deteriorated after dark as temperatures dropped through the 20's. Wind chill indices were in the teens during most of the snowstorm. Actual air temperatures fell into the teens as the snow ended. These cold temperatures reduced the effectiveness of road salt, which slowed recovery efforts in the wake of the storm.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Snow developed along an Arctic cold front as it sliced southeast across southern Illinois during the morning hours. As the front slowed down over the Tennessee Valley late in the day, a weak surface low developed on the front. This caused snow to linger across the Ohio River counties through the evening hours. The result was an area of heavy snowfall from Vienna south and east, where 4 to 7 inches was reported. The heaviest reported snowfall was in Massac County near Metropolis, where 7 inches fell. Across the remainder of southern Illinois, including Marion, Carbondale, and Harrisburg, amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches. Visibility was frequently reduced below one mile in the heavy snowfall area. Much of the snow melted on treated road surfaces during the day, but conditions rapidly deteriorated after dark as temperatures dropped through the 20's. Wind chill indices were in the teens during most of the snowstorm. Actual air temperatures fell into the teens as the snow ended. These cold temperatures reduced the effectiveness of road salt, which slowed recovery efforts in the wake of the storm.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Snow developed along an Arctic cold front as it sliced southeast across southern Illinois during the morning hours. As the front slowed down over the Tennessee Valley late in the day, a weak surface low developed on the front. This caused snow to linger across the Ohio River counties through the evening hours. The result was an area of heavy snowfall from Vienna south and east, where 4 to 7 inches was reported. The heaviest reported snowfall was in Massac County near Metropolis, where 7 inches fell. Across the remainder of southern Illinois, including Marion, Carbondale, and Harrisburg, amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches. Visibility was frequently reduced below one mile in the heavy snowfall area. Much of the snow melted on treated road surfaces during the day, but conditions rapidly deteriorated after dark as temperatures dropped through the 20's. Wind chill indices were in the teens during most of the snowstorm. Actual air temperatures fell into the teens as the snow ended. These cold temperatures reduced the effectiveness of road salt, which slowed recovery efforts in the wake of the storm. The new snowfall on top of snow from the January 12th storm raised total snow depths to near 10 inches near the Ohio River.",

A second person was killed when a pick-up truck lost control onto the right shoulder and struck a semi-trailer on southbound Interstate 294 near Burr Ridge.  In Kane County, a driver was killed in a crash involving three cars and a bus on Illinois Highway 31 north of Oak Street near North Aurora.||A 20 car pile up involving a semi occurred on Interstate 57 near 159th Street and was spread out over a quarter of a mile.  A crash involving two semi trucks was reported on southbound Interstate 294 near Interstate 57.  Numerous sections of Interstates and roadways were closed while accidents were cleared.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A moist 500 mb shortwave trough tracked east from the Plains, causing a surface low pressure center to develop northeast from Texas to the central Appalachians. Widespread wintry precipitation occurred as colder air filtered south on the back side of the low. Around one-tenth of an inch of ice glazed surfaces across southern Illinois. Near the onset of precipitation, a period of sleet was reported. Most of the precipitation fell in the form of freezing rain. The automated observing station at the Carbondale airport measured 0.11 inch of ice accretion. Most of the icing was on trees, power lines, and elevated surfaces during the precipitation. After the precipitation ended, temperatures fell through the 20's, causing icy spots to develop even on paved surfaces. Slick roads and motor vehicle accidents were common during the early morning hours. Several wrecks occurred on Interstate 57. In Union County, a tractor-trailer rig crashed and caught fire on Interstate 57. In Franklin County, a Greyhound bus crashed into a trailer being pulled by a sport utility vehicle.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "A strong tornado developed around 7 miles southeast of Vandalia, Illinois around 4:20 PM CDT and traveled northeast to the Fayette/Effingham County line by 4:34 PM CDT. The first tornado damage observed was near the intersection of E1050 Avenue and N1375 Street where a greenhouse lost portions of its roofing material and suffered other minor damage. The tornado continued northeast toward Gatch Lake causing damage to several outbuildings and one single family residence. The width of the tornado increased to nearly 100 yards wide and the strength increased from EF0 to EF1 during this time period. The tornado continued northeast causing mainly tree damage until it reached a farm along E1200 Avenue near N1780 Lane. Here a barn and several silos were destroyed, along with a single wide mobile home. The damage was rated EF2. Thankfully there were no occupants in the mobile home at the time of the tornado. The tornado continued northeast destroying another outbuilding, with the debris being tossed down wind hundreds of yards into the open field.  The greatest tornado damage occurred to a residence near the intersection of Illinois Highway 185 and E1250 Avenue. The tornado destroyed their garage, ripped their roof and southeast walls off of their home. This damage was also rated EF2 with winds estimated to be 125 mph. The tornado began to weaken as it moved northeast only causing minor damage to an outbuilding and downing trees in a narrow path, less than a hundred yards wide, to the Fayette/Effingham county line. No injuries or deaths were reported in Fayette County.  The tornado continued northeast into Effingham County (WFO Lincoln's forecast area). This segment of the tornado (Fayette County) was rated EF2 with a path length of 10.87 miles and a max path width of 100 yards. The entire tornado was rated EF2. It's path length was 18.27 miles with a max path width of 100 yards.",

Thunderstorms earlier in the day dropped locally heavy rainfall of 3-5 inches across portions of Coles County, including 3.76 in Charelston.  Due to excessive rainfall rates over a short period of time, flash flooding occurred in the Charleston-Mattoon area.

The circulation exited southern Illinois along the Wabash River southeast of Carmi. A fifth tornado was associated with a circulation that tracked east across Massac and Pope Counties in the southern tip of the state.  The severe storm outbreak occurred ahead of a cold front that accelerated east-southeast toward the mid Mississippi Valley. Cooling aloft ahead of a shortwave trough over the Plains, combined with diurnal heating and moist southerly winds, resulted in a corridor of deepening convection ahead of the front. Steep mid-level lapse rates and strong effective wind shear promoted some large hail within the strongest storms.",

Many locations picked up anywhere from 0.5 to 1.2 of snow, particularly in the southern tip of the state. This was the 1st measurable snow in the month of April since 1983 for many locations. Impacts to travel were minimal due to warm pavement temperatures, which melted the snow on roadways. The highest reported snow amount was 1.2 inches in Golconda in Pope County.",

Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms. Mid-level winds around 50 knots located just ahead of the shortwave helped to create moderate to strong deep-layer wind shear, favorable for a few supercells.",

Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms. Mid-level winds around 50 knots located just ahead of the shortwave helped to create moderate to strong deep-layer wind shear, favorable for a few supercells.",

Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms. Mid-level winds around 50 knots located just ahead of the shortwave helped to create moderate to strong deep-layer wind shear, favorable for a few supercells.",

The tornado passed near the community of Wolf Lake before dissipating at the edge of the Shawnee National Forest just east of Route 3. A very large equipment barn collapsed, and another barn was destroyed. A one-story house was partially shifted off its foundation. All structural damage was between Route 3 and the Mississippi River levee. The tornado was witnessed by at least one trained spotter and several other individuals. Prior to spawning this tornado, the parent storm produced a tornado near Trail of Tears State Park in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri about ten minutes earlier.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Multiple rounds of thunderstorms impacted the region on the last day of May. Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms. Mid-level winds around 50 knots located just ahead of the shortwave helped to create moderate to strong deep-layer wind shear, favorable for a few supercells.",

The survey team did find one area of concentrated damage just northwest of Elsah which it determined was caused by a brief EF-0 tornado. The tornado touched down about one quarter mile SSW of the Green Acres Road and Elsah Road intersection here 3 pine trees were blown over. The tornado then removed part of the roof from an out building on the west side of Elsah Road. Portions of the roof were found blown across Elsah Road to the southeast. The tornado then crossed Lake Drive just west of Red Bud Court where it twisted a road sign 180 degrees and snapped a number of trees near their base. The tornado continued southeast crossing Elsah Road near Joywood Drive where several trees were again snapped. The tornado dissipated shortly thereafter. The tornado was rated EF0 with max wind speeds of 80 MPH. The path length was 1.40 miles and a max path width of 50 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported with this tornado.",

Widespread wind damage occurred with this long-lived complex, which met the definition of a derecho. This convective system took shape over the Missouri/Iowa border region and then progressed south-southeast to the Tennessee Valley by late evening. A very moist and unstable air mass set the stage for this derecho. Surface dew points were near 80 degrees, with mixed-layer capes over 4000 j/kg. When the atmosphere is that unstable, wind shear does not need to be particularly strong for significant severe weather to occur. The bulk wind shear in the 0 to 6 km layer averaged 20 to 30 knots. Deep northerly wind flow averaged around 20 knots from 850 to 500 mb on the front side of a high pressure ridge.",

A grain bin sustained damaged along 130th Avenue near the beginning of the track. The path then continued to the northeast where a barn was rolled about 20 yards off its foundation. Another barn sustained heavy roof damage.  The tornado continued northeast toward 147th Street where some large trees sustained damage. The tornado lifted as it moved northeast of 147th Street. Overall the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 1.65 miles and a max path width of 25 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported with this tornado.",

Steep lapse rates due to relatively cold mid level temperatures southeast of the upper level low combined with strong low-mid level wind shear due to an 80-kt mid level wind max southeast of the upper level low. This led to the development of isolated low topped supercells along the northward moving warm front and ahead of the eastward moving cold front. Eight tornadoes were surveyed over WFO LSX's forecast area.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "A tornado touched down over the Country Classic Cars business northeast of Staunton, IL. Many videos surfaced showing a funnel develop and pass over Interstate 55. No damage could be seen west of the interstate, creating the initial damage to a carport at the business, and then cutting an approximately 50 yard path through the middle portion of the second storage shed on the property. The tornado proceeded east, depositing several pieces of sheet metal and wood onto Old Route 66 and fields to the east. Despite visible power flashed in videos, power lines looked untouched. Arching likely occurred when metal sheeting was thrown across the lines. A debris path could be seen strewn for several hundred feet to the northeast. A house, couple of farm buildings and trees were damaged on the south side of Tall Timber Road. Another structure to the north side of Tall Timber Road, at the end of Adden Road, was also damaged. Several pieces of debris could be seen in the field to the northeast of   Adden Road and to the west of Two Mile Road. However, no damage was assessed past the field, where it is likely the tornado dissipated. Additional videos from Mt. Olive show a long rope funnel ascended above the town with no damage to the community. Overall the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 1.39 miles and a max path width of 50 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported with this tornado.",

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.

The tornado continued northeast, crossing over Blue Grass Creek where it continued to do mainly tree damage. The worst damage was found near Oil Field Road, where a few outbuildings were destroyed. A family residence sustained some minor roof and shingle damage as the tornado crossed Oil Field Road and dissipated. Overall, the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 1.97 miles and a max path width of 50 yards. No injuries or deaths were reported with this tornado.",

It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings.  The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.  In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.  Total damage was estimated at $118.9 million.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An historic tornado outbreak occurred across Illinois on December 1st, with a total of 29 tornadoes touching down across the central part of the state.  This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.",
